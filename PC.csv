Source ID,If you could change anything about the sales or design centre process  what would it be?
TAM09191035,The location was inconvenient.
TAM1015109,"The time for delivery.  I know you gave 10,0000 bonus at the design centre,  great Job, but next time if you add the appliances too will beperfect ??."
TAM0911126,"Extra bedroom in first floor ,finished carage with shelves and closed kitchen"
TAM02201002,"We have mixed reviews for the builder. On the one hand, we were very disappointed with the inflexibility of construction. We did not have the option to choose the specific lot with the specific model we wanted - that made it very difficult as there was a specific lot I was after which did not have the model I wanted. We have purchased from a competing builder and they were very flexible with this kind of thing - that was our reference point. The thing that bothered us the most though was they were unwilling to add a bathroom in the basement (or even a rough-in) when that is a standard that all builders we spoke to offer. On the other hand, we were exceptionally grateful when, after we were informed that the closing was delayed, we were allowed to make changes at the design center. We understand that the builder did not have to accept our changes, but did so anyway and we really appreciated that.  So while the staff and the process was great, the inflexibility (particularly with the rough-in bathroom) was what we did not like. I am also wondering why we were not called for a Frame Check Walk-Through."
TAM0510103,"I would not subject anyone to Henrietta at the Design Center.  We found her to be difficult with regard to communication, rude and unable to fatham that we required technical explanation for some of the details she was attempting to explain.  The experience with Henrietta was not pleasant.  Kim Knuth, on the other hand, was wonderful."
TAM1012119,When the salesman was asked questions they would get defensive.  I asked about cracked basements and they got defensive.
TAM1012102,Everything has been great. If something went wrong we greatly appreciated staff going above and beyond to rectify it. We had the tile we picked for our main floor become discontinued...we went in and picked out another plus a different backsplash as it no longer matched the new tile. Staff were able to allow us an upgraded tile as we could not find another we liked in the standard selection.
TAM02201003,Get the house in time ( no delays)
TAM0516111,Tamarack staff were exceptional! Muskoka representative came across stressed.
TAM0310113,"Our overall experience with Tamarack has been good, but the unavailability of appointments at the design centre has caused a delay in our house construction and has been a source of major disappointment for us. We have had to wait 4-6 weeks for each appointment and even then we had one appointment rescheduled on multiple occasions by Tamarack. Although our designer was extremely professional, helpful and knowledgeable, she appeared exhausted and we found the whole design process very disorganized compared to other builders such as Urbandale and Minto. This has affected our closing date (we have not had a framing inspection and we could not complete certain parts of this survey) and has caused us to question if we would recommend Tamarack to our friends and family. We would highly recommend that you hire another design consultant during busy periods."
TAM0112111,"Too many options at the design centre...why can't the tiny options bundled together or included in the purchase price ?

The sales person from Stittsville sales center, Valerie, is awsome. Because of her I ended up owning a Tamarack home. 

I visited other sals centres as well, but they were not friendly with me at all."
TAM08181051,No comments.
TAM0815115,allow more time at the design centre
TAM0816133,"Everything was perfect, very well organized"
TAM0515104,"Sales: We would appreciate if the agent that recommended to us Tamarack Cardinal Creek was recognized by your company. He is with Remax, Greg Hamre. Thank you.
Design centre: It was often hard to get a staff member on the line and sometimes, it is better to explain ourselves over the phone. 
Other than that, super!"
TAM0312114,nothing at all. So far it's been great.
TAM09171025,I would give the option to buyers to put a rough in washroom as standard in basement. But overall Jaqui is a amazing sales person and great to have in any company and Tamarack is Lucky to have her and good for the buyers too she is very helpful.
TAM0815121,"better show room, mark-up way to i for the up grade, don't appreciate to pay twice some material already paid in purchase price
more UN-satisfaction to be submitted soon"
TAM0614111,"Worked with Louise and she was fantastic! She was able to accommodate us before Christmas she was flexible and available almost like part of our family.
PART 3    was answered 5(could not skip that part) because they bought a model home N/A"
TAM0911127,Obnoxiously high costs and markup on upgrades on simple things like plumbing and potlights.
TAM0210110,More time during the review and selection process would have been nice.
TAM1118108,"Sales Centre:  would be nice to have a sales rep accompany customer into the model homes to explain what are standard, upgrades and able to ask questions on the spot.   It is overwhelming to remember all questions when returning to the sales office. 

Design Center: More affordable items for upgrades,  nice upgraded are too expensive.

Home: hired a home inspector who flagged life threating issues in the home.  1.)  Door from garage to home wouldn't close shut. Causing concern that carbon monoxide would leak into the house due to car parked in the garage. 2.) gas pipe in the back yard was too short (was below the deck , not above the deck and was from the door as the other surrounding homes).  Gas Pipe was too close to the patio door and was advised to not open the door until the pipe fitted to proper size as gas may leak into the house.  Was unable to open the window and doors until this issue was resolved.    
The above wouldn't have been detected without spending $400-$500 for home inspection and attention to these dangerous issues should be properly inspected prior to possession of home.    They still have small deficiencies that are pending. 


Note for CEO:  prices to hang TV over the fireplace was too expensive ($500)  plus wiring and only cost a under $200 to do afterwards.   Little consideration to buyer with pricing would be appreciated as we are spending a lot to purchase a home.   Would have liked a second sink in the second washroom but wanted a lot of money to add the second sink. 
Overall, very happy."
TAM0213117,"upgrades are overpriced, and feel some items eg. crown moulding should be standard."
TAM06191014,NOTHING
TAM0414113,"Be able to offer some to the things that tamarack wouldn't do- cover back porch, stone number, pot lights on exterior second level, picket doors"
TAM02182007,"1. Make separate show home without any upgrades, which has only standard feature, easy to identify how home will look like.
2. At design Center, not lot of options in standard feature, need to add more, mostly in cabinet.
3. Home owner should give entry to home, one time in a month before 3 months of closing, to see progress."
TAM07191000,* There was a limited selection of bathroom and kitchen plumbing fixtures.  Would like to see far more options available.
TAM10171037,"1. Instructions on survey not to hit ""previous button"" here since you lose all your comments and have to do it over!!
2. The capability of your sales team other than Jackie! SO I gave low scores in the first survey section.
The general feel the sales resources give is one of being bothered by clients coming in to the model homes and at times were even eating and so you feel like you are intruding on them. Their typical answer to almost any question was ""I will have to get Jackie to answer that"". You almost lost us initially, but we knew you were good so we came back 2 or 3 times...and then that magical day we got to talk to Jackie...and we did the deal then and there! Jackie is your STAR and she represents TAMARACK as it should be and she knows all the details. Once we bought the house, we brought friends in to see the model since they are looking too...and the typical sales force was there and our friends felt such a negative attitude they left and think we are nuts to buy from TAMARCK with such disrespectful sales force....they did not get to meet Jackie...we may bring them back some other time.
My impression is that there is lots of time when hosting a model home to be studying the product, options, packages, etc... and they should know everything they can about what they are selling..... and maybe you should test them biweekly and give them prizes or gift cards for improving their skills...they do not seem motivated to learn more...and we have been talking to them for 8 months now...Last weekend I even had to tell them that the AC unit in the basement of the model home was creating a pool of water on the basement floor....there were no clients in the home at the time but they did not even check...
I know this will make your sales resources upset, but as a senior leader in INVISTA, I think you need to know the truth or you can not change things and I am a pretty credible resource for this, with no reason other than to try and help you succeed. I think you are an excellent builder. And I have been upfront and honest with Jackie, Carolyn, Mike, Steve and Pierre. I look forward to moving in to our new house!"
TAM0911105,"it will be good if we had more time in design center, we felt we run out of time. we had excellent time but people working there were very busy it seems their plate were full. thanks for asking yonas"
TAM0915112,"I would have appreciated having a better package of documents advising us of our upgrade choices in advance of our meeting with the design consultant.  A friend showed me their ""upgrade book"" from Mattamy which came with pictures and detailed explanations of each upgrade. It saves time at the design appointment and helps the customer to be better informed. I probably would have gone with more upgrades if I had a picture of what the ""standard"" looked like."
TAM0615109,"We wish it was made more clear that we had the option to choose a security system from concept rather than having to buy a security system from Alliance.  We do not regret going with Alliance for security, but the options were not clear until I spoke with the rep from Concept after already committing to a security system with Alliance.

Harding representative did not provide me the information I requested regarding the ERV upgrade.  My e-mail went unanswered.  We decided not to go ahead with the upgrade due to the lack of willingness to provide information by Harding.  It would have been good if the upgrades list contained a bit more details regarding upgrades like this such as the model of the ERV being offered and what was meant by ""Ultima Control"".

Tank less water heater rental through Cricket Energy requires signing a contract for 10 years without having much details regarding how to terminate the contract or what it would cost to buy the water heater outright from them after 1, 2, or 3 years of renting.  Direct Energy provided that information outright when we rented our current water heater.   We are awaiting a representative from Cricket energy to contact us to get some clarifications prior to signing any such long term contracts.

Aside from the above, we would change nothing else.  We were impressed particularly with the help we got from Kim Knuth.  She was very helpful to us during the design center process and both of us felt she took our taste and liking into consideration and helped us make the best selections for us.  As the current owners of a new build from another builder, we can't help but compare the design center experience which was night and day thanks to Kim."
TAM05191027,"Wish we had bought sooner so all the options would have been available. Otherwise, very satisfied so far."
TAM0310120,More time for the design centre process. I felt rushed.
TAM07181001,Everything would be less expensive!
TAM08171009,Introduce a design software that could let clients have a better idea of the design of their home
TAM1116119,"Subcontractor Concept Homes wasn't easy to deal with. We had simple questions regarding installation of central vac, potlights, and a conduit and they didn't get back to us for days for an appointment. They also have terrible hours of operation and don't give clients much choice. In the end we didn't end up getting anything with them because of their lack of service."
TAM0211115,"During the sales process, if there is an available options list (those options only available during the sales process) that would be great. Due to lacking of information, we missed a few options during the sales process and when we found out it was too late. For example front door upgrade, garage door upgrade etc. And also some information provided are not accurate. I was asking if I could upgrade the window of a bedroom. The answer I got is I cannot get a larger window, and the only option for me is to add an extra window. So I took the option. However, later I found the same model on my street (Lot 46) got the upgrade. And also, until yesterday, the extra window I purchased still not yet installed even the dry-wall has already been completed. Now I am very concerning about the impact on my home overall quality.

During the design process, the ceramic price tags were wrong. At the beginning we chosen Red class for everything. However when we start the pricing, those kinds of ceramic all need pricing and the the price we received are so much different than the Red Class price listed on the price list.  This issue had caused a big chaos during our design center phase. So an accurate price list would help buyer to well budget during the design centre phase, and I also can see this could improve Tamarack design centre productivity."
TAM0510125,"An efficient system of coordination & communication between the sales office and the design centre. The design centre is far too busy to accommodate the tight construction schedules placed on the home buyer, hence delaying the closing date (as in my case)."
TAM0512126,design centre:If they can get the prices quickly for upgrade iteams would be great.
TAM1012112,Since I bought the model home question no 2 I have no concern.  I was greeted with smiles that made me feel at home on the spot.  Congratulations.
TAM07181042,The Sales Representative - This lady she has no manners she does not say hi in emails she does not greet. She may need Greeting Training - I was called Kido a couple of times by her. I am young but its not professional. She needs to treat me with respect.
TAM0514112,"I would have liked the stairs to the deck on the opposite side.  I have a small child and would have liked the her not to run into stairs as soon as she stepped outside.  I didn't realize this until right before he plan reading.  I wish there had been more flexibility.  I was told it was too late and this had to be covered in structural meeting.
The stairs and deck has not been installed yet.  I was also told that it was easy to switch, so I could do it myself after closing.  I dont understand why this request couldnt have been accomodated."
TAM0214111,The whole process of choosing interiors of the house at the design centre seems not long enough to let you choose the best available choice. Only Christine seemed to know about all the upgrades and available choices.
TAM07181038,I would like to have some snack to share / normally the presentation is prolonged and need something to eat
TAM0716117,They need to improve their dealings with the site super and make it more accommodating for homeowners to view their homes.  Time slots  that makes sense to the homeowner (we work) - Tamarack is  not flexible at all 9am- 2pm slots    and that is it.
TAM1216114,Completely satisfied. Excellent selection and knowledge from staff
TAM0816103,A few times a different points there was less than a direct answer given to some questions that we asked and felt a little deceived or at least not fully informed and therefore taken by surprise for some costs.
TAM0912113,The Process was seemless and very well handled.  Although this was not our first time around building a home through a builder the process was very enjoyable with no surprises.  Tamarack has been very informative and a pleasure to do business with.
TAM0310102,n/a
TAM04191012,"allow the ""bonus"" money to come off the purchase price...the Tamarack standards are beautify enough!!"
TAM1211110,able to visit home more during construction
TAM08191006,That they have the right information and if they say something is to be in the home and promise to take care of the client then they should’ve.
TAM0613105,"As far as the design center is concerned, when I first went there to take a look on my own to prepare myself for my initial meeting, I felt overwhelmed and that things were disorganized.  The staff were amazing and really walked me through the entire process, when we had our final meeting we were happy with our choices and did not second guess our design decisions.  This was a seamless process with excellent customer service. Thank you"
TAM0212111,"More free offers, have a model house available so we can see, we brought the Bristol but had to drive to Kingston to see the model house."
TAM07181035,"i loved the customer service experience I had with Tamarack. The only thing I would of preferred is more of a simpler pricing list for the design center. the catalogue that is provided is long, confusing and we did not utilize it at all."
TAM1111105,"2 items:
Having the sales office open on Fridays (could be closed on Mondays). 

It would be great if the design centre made appointments in the evenings. We had to take time off from work."
TAM1211104,"We felt that some of the interactions with the sales representative at the Jackson Trails site were not completely genuine, therefore it was hard to feel comfortable at times.  Unfortunately, since there was only only one sales representative for the Jackson Trails site, there weren't any other options at the time of signing the purchase agreement. So far, the sales/signing of the agreement has been our least favourite part of our new home purchase."
TAM10191033,No comments
TAM07181017,"The design  prices are a bit high.  We bought 5 homes from diff builders and we did not want to pay 4,000 extra upgrade to put in A/C   Tamarack should at least finish the house to allow electrical copper lines to go in.  Putting an A/C costs 2,000."
TAM1014113,"Because I was the first to meet with the design center (of my development), the representative was not adequately prepared with the information regarding upgrades and standard options. This lead to confusion and poorly executed quotes for upgraded items."
TAM0111100,I wish my backsplash wasn't on back order. As I am not as happy with what I had to choose instead.
TAM12191016,nothing
TAM04182023,"- give more standard options
- i should be able to go to the sales centre and ask about the granite countertop in the main bath to the sales centre and should be able to find out what level of upgrade it is. should not have to bounce between sales centre and design centre
- also, sales centre of community i bought in is somewhat helpful after the purchase, but say you go to sales centre in another community (post purchase) just to look at the model homes - and you ask them question about the designs done therein, they are far far far from helpful. they just tell us to go and enquire in design centre"
TAM0311109,"The Muskoka kitchen modification pricing was a bit obscure and riddled with errors and double charges. Unfortunately many of our inquires directed to Muskoka were ignored to the point that we eventually gave up and had to move on.

Kim and Mandy from the design center were extremely knowledgeable and helpful, a pleasure to deal with. I can't praise Daryl enough for his help and attention to detail."
TAM0614222,"I think it would be so much more efficient and effective if all prices for upgrades were available through the design centre.  For example, the solid surfaces were not priced (by square foot) so no idea which ones were more/less expensive.  Same with the backsplash.   Full disclosure pricing would be helpful in the design process.

It would also be beneficial if there were pictures of full rooms/homes with some of the upgrades (especially flooring and cabinets).  It is hard to imagine an entire floor or full kitchen when looking at a small sample."
TAM02182003,"Thé cost of upgrade are  not explained, when questions asked to mme champagne very poor feedback, when problems with partners concept and Mondeau no help at all"
TAM0610122,Both centres were fine and the representives are kind and friendly.  i would not change a think.
TAM1013123,"It would be great if the design centre had preset design color packages put together. They have really good suggestions. 

The sales centre process is pretty good as is."
TAM1016121,More time to make design decisions.
TAM0811106,I found the process of researching kitchen sinks and faucets upgrades online on and then sending options to Tamarak for availability and pricing very frustrating. I do not live in the Kingston area so could not access the plumbing contract store locally. (The staff at the store who normally work with Tamarak clients were not available on the 2days that we were in the area purchasing our home.) It might have been easier to have been suppiled with a list of available sinks and faucets upgrades and then asked to choose from those.
TAM08171001,"Nothing, seems to work great to me!"
TAM08171021,None
TAM0615103,Informing the sales staff that ALL traffic headed to Laporte Nursery will be coming through the development.  This could easily be 1000 cars ao any spring Saturday.  Not at all hapy about that as I had to find it out from Nursery staff.  I was told this would not be a permanent  situation and it better not be as I do not want to be living on a commercial throughfare.  (That is why I purchased in a RESIDENTIAL development. ) It was almost enough for me to pull out of the deal and I am sure current buyers a d prospective ones are still not being informed of this situation.   That should have been disclosed from the beginning.  GET LAPORTES NURSERY BACK TO HAVING THEIR OWN DEDICATED ENTRANCE ASAP!!
TAM0610110,"The design center employees are extremely busy, they are rushed off their feet, I would expect they will all have nervous breakdowns!!!  This makes (through no fault of their own) a very unpleasant experience at the design centre.  It creates a very stressful atmosphere.  The appointment times are too short.  We found Kim very pleasant and helpful but she just didn't have a second to spare.  
We found dealing with Muskoka frustrating because of their incorrect knowledge of the building code and to tell you the truth  -  we've just got our fingers crossed, hoping we are going to get what we think we are getting."
TAM01181016,Had to go to work.
TAM0711137,"I am delighted with my Tamarack Home and the almost $60K in upgrades.  This clearly generates a very generous profit margin for Tamarack.  No regrets there.

Further, your records will confirm that my referral Blair Hurd has already purchased in Findlay Creek.  So as you can see I am a center of influence in my professional life and as such a valuable source of Tamarack business.  

But my referrals have come to an abrupt halt resulting which will result in a few less sales for Tamarack.  And I'd genuinely prefer to reverse that decision.

I am not happy.

There were two instances whereby I required clarification or decisions from Head Office at which point Tamarack fell into a deafening silence.  

I am a Senior Financial Planner at Investors Group and a former Partner at Doyle Salewski Inc..  I provide as well as expect a level of professionalism and I cannot accept being treated in this fashion.

So to Chris and Scott, your product is sound but my Tamarack experience remains unsatisfactory.  I have been left to feel it's Tamarack's way or 'the highway'.  

So is Tamarack responsive to its Pre-Closing Surveys?  

And in all cases to be clear, I am genuinely looking forward to taking possession of my Tamarack Home and for that I thank you.

Respectfully in your hands,

Gerald W. (Gerry)  Doyle

TAM07191007,More interest in the purchaser at the sales centre I went to them re concerns and did not receive any response. The design process went well again no response to emails sent.
TAM08171014,"I would recommend that Tamarack's design centre become more aware that not all buyers will be residents of Ottawa when they purchase their home. This only applies of course if Tamarack wants to sell homes to all potential buyers from across Canada and elsewhere. I initially got reticence about my design centre meetings as mine had to be held by phone and not in person. I don't even want to guess where I'd be if my sales person, Deborah, had not continually intervened to make things happen."
TAM07181037,To see the model homes.  It would be nice if Somebody answered the phone not a good option for reception it would be nice if they picked up and conveyed the message I found this inconvenient.  They contact me whenever.    The communication through email is good. The sales centre I bought from Meadows was very good.  I was referred to go to Orleans to see model and they were not welcoming at all at this other centre. When you fist walk in they ask are you buying from Orleans or Barhavaen Centre. Meadow and Orleans huge difference. Instead of Orleans entertaining my ideas and questions she more or less was busy enough to tell me she did not have enough time it was rushing and brief.
TAM0912104,Basic choices at the design centre (specifically cabinetry) could be upgraded slightly.  The basic choices are VERY limited.
TAM0211103,"Sales rep demeanor was not friendly.  It took time to get her to be responsive to our concerns -- tendency was to say 'No, it's not possible' before checking with management.  

customer service experience was not friendly - improvement is needed."
TAM1015114,nothing.
TAM1016132,nothing
TAM1109117,A little more time for the design process; more straightforward on closing date process i.e. realistic dates & better communication about reason for constant delays.
TAM1216100,"I would STRONGLY advise Tamarack to hire more personnel in the Design Office to accommodate clients schedules. I always felt pressured to hurry in selecting my upgrades and discuss my concerns and present my questions. Overall it was very stressful and I felt I was taking up time from the Design Consultant because she seemed overwhelmed and very tense and rushed at all times. She was very knowledgeable although Tamarack do not provide them with all the information and pricing for the upgrades. So the client is told on many occasions to wait a few days until certain prices comes in from who knows where!  I would ensure clients deal with ONLY one Design consultant who is trained in all aspects of the purchase of the upgrades, material and finishings of a home instead of having to contact and meet so many consultants and workers at the Design Center or by telephone and emails. It becomes overwhelming for clients who have personal and professional schedules to go through this complicated process. 

 I would provide more actual upgrade materials to view at the Design Center, ex: pedestal sinks, faucets, fireplace options... I would not show clients upgrades that are not available at the Cardinal Creek location ex: wood flooring that is in the Design Center but is off limit for those clients.  

 I would plan quiet space for discussions between the Design Consultant and her clients; the noise level becomes a real headache for the client and the consultant as well, when you are trying to concentrate especially at the final sign off meeting. The Design of the Center itself is very confusing and does not help the client orient herself in the chaos of the multiple choices scattered all over the Design Center. Clients walk/run from one area to another,  back and forth  at every visit. It is very chaotic in there and time consuming, very inefficient!

I would hire new Sales personnel at the Cardinal Creek Village location. I have experienced a major mistake from the SR at the Cardinal location where I had made a deposit on the Eton model; 1 month later I was informed the wrong model, a Foxcroft had been built instead!  I had to change models and or location!! Later I chose the Chelsea at an extra cost and Tamarack DID NOT compensate me for their major mistake! Tamarack never provided an excuse either. Nothing. I am still very annoyed by that lack of professionalism and cowardness, as well as improper customer service in regards to that mistake that cost me in the end. On top of that,  the dry wall on the  Chelsea  I purchased was installed without proper communication from the Sales representative so my decisions on electrical outlets and speakers were not considered. Thanks to Debbie, she managed to waive the additional expenses that I would have had to incur.  I very much appreciated her efforts in assisting me, after all I had been thorough. 

Thank you I hope my comments will make a difference  in the way Tamarack interacts with the clients who give them a lot of money. I still feel very angry by the way I was treated in the major error that was made in the mix up of the Eton model I had previously chosen which turned out to be a Foxcroft... That mistake should have been acknowledge by Tamarack and I SHOULD have been financially compensated for their major mistake. To this day I have not heard from them... 

Christiane Gamache"
TAM0712132,"Just one thing at the design centre: either add an extra visit to the 3 or get more accomplished at the first appt, ie: get flooring picked/priced and kitchen cupboards minimum.  We made 3 or 4 extra visits on our own and took many digital pictures so we could study at home.  Our final visit was basically our 2nd with our associate and things were not yet at a finalized state...an additional visit should be encorporated in the process.  Otherwise were very happy with the selections and the service."
TAM1213106,It's perfect
TAM07181023,design centre appointment was promised to be November and we did not have an appointment until January.  Keep your promises.
TAM0911103,Also initially became aware of Tamarack by newspaper.
TAM1109110,"One of the question was:
During the walk-through inspection of your home during construction...
So far, there was no such inspection (perhaps it will happen closer to the date the house will be finished)."
TAM0212106,I would not change anything at all. Service was perfect could not have asked for anything better.
TAM0511101,I would allow owners access to their homes in advance to the initial house inspection in order to prepare all of their questions.
TAM0915128,The software used by the design centre is way to disorganized. It should be structured so each upgrade it listed by room but it is instead listed by what ever pricing was first typed in.  We are extremely concerns this will perhaps cause missteps on the upgrades.  It took us hours to review what we ordered.  You need to purchase better software for your team as this part of the process made us feel like we were doing the job since we had to jump all over the numerous documents to review.
TAM0613125,"nothing they are very helpful. ,This is our second tamarack home and we are very satisfied."
TAM1011138,"To make sure that the options offered are available and compatible with the accessories ( eg. shower stall and optional doors are compatible). 
Make sure the material at the design centre is still available at the time of choice (eg. discontinued tiles).
Educate the client as to different possibilities in regards to improvements in options selected by other clients (eg. Kitchen cupboards, floor layouts)"
TAM10191050,Nothing
TAM10171016,Would like more email updates on next steps and timing - ie are we on track for current closing date?
TAM07191042,"1. There is a disconnect regarding product availability and upgrade selections. 
2. There are a number of standard fixtures including lighting, towel bars and toilet rolls and I’m sure others that are not mentioned in the design center and I suppose we’re stuck with those or doing the work to replace them ourselves (which isn’t our strength).
3. Even with the items where upgrades are offered, there are very little visuals of what the options might be available in the showroom, we were left to google photos of what we like and hope there was something cost effective that was similar. It felt very backward."
TAM0613103,It was difficult to think of something to change.  I suppose the only thing I can think of would be to have some activities or space for children that come with parents to the sales centre.
TAM1013125,You need better customer service at the design center.
TAM0614106,I would possibly suggest the design centre to have longer hours till 9pm during the week days to accommodate work schedule of those buyers better.
TAM1111112,that the Design centre would be closer to the site and you can do compare easily with model homes
TAM09181034,"The construction is different from the design map. I pointed that out, but I have not got any response. Frustrated!"
TAM04191010,The tile section in the deseign Center should have more categories of pricing. As well an easier way to look through them in the bins.
TAM07181027,1. The decision on hardwood stairs was needed almost immediately after signing and before I'd had time to choose hardwood and select my other upgrades (to determine if hardwood stairs would fit in my budget).
TAM0815116,No change
TAM08181025,Need an extra appointment at the design.  Design center personnel needs to come better acquainted with the tax being added to the options 13 - 19 percent:
TAM10191027,None that I can think of right now.
TAM0811103,"Difficult to remember the colours of all items chosen.
Would it be possible to have visual picture (thumbnail)?"
TAM0311107,We wish there were more time to decide on the upgrade options that were to be done the sale centre.
TAM07191032,"The design centre, the cabinet team.  they left out some of the basic things.  Like the microwave.  Like the sliding microwave.  I thought they would supply guidance.  They did give us some about the island but they didn't say anything about the crown molding or the microwave.  They could use some improvement."
TAM1114102,Show more color choices and give more help in choosing
TAM0311100,"Better choice of options at the design center, better supplier referrals.  (Was referred on supplier sheet to Boone plumbing, but they wouldn't deal with me as a Tamarack customer."
TAM08171010,The design centre process seemed a bit rushed.
TAM1113102,If I'm choosing not to install some fixtures or hardware I should be able to keep it since I'm paying for it.
TAM1014109,Interactive computer program allowing you to see changes done to the interior of the home.
TAM1011119,"1. Original sale: 

Val and staff are professional and knowledgeable as to what they are responsible for and for what they need additional approval for they are quick to obtain the information.

             Change: nothing

2. Subsequent modification to agreement (B/S to walk out/ rev to std elv): 

Debi and Gary where quick to respond to the issue and where more than understanding of the situation and made very attempt to accommodate and they worked hard to resolve an awkward situation into a positive resolution. Working with Val/Carroll as well helped greatly.

              Change: nothing. Debi stepped in when she needed 

3. Design centre: 

Kim was great to work with and fully understood what we where looking for in our second purchase from Tamarack . She work diligently in vetting and explaining any requests. 

The same cannot be said for our experience with Muskoka Kitchens. this process was a total debacle. After meeting with Ewa and explaining in detail with measurements and providing appliance specifications we later where told we had to RE-explain to another consultant Gayle. Working with Gayle was a total failure, after meeting with her to explain what we said to Ewa and re-providing the same appliance information a second time we received an odd e-mail requesting for us to reply where we wanted items that we did not request. We immediately call her to clarify and to review the plan as earlier explained. Gayle could not review our file as she had lost all the information and was working from erroneous information from a another client. We had to repeat all the information over the phone and re-send the appliance specs again. We requested and received confirmation of this via e-mail. We lost faith in Gayle getting it right and we requested Kim to ensure all was correct with regards to cabinetry. Kim, not wanting any mistakes compounded or delays to occur as a result of Gayle's lack of QC,  took full control and coordinated with us vs-a-vs Muskoka. Kim ensured all was as requested and corrected many omissions afterwards (there where many)


             Change: Have Kim/Tamarack staff directly work with customer with Muskoka present. Inital 3 way meeting (tam/client/musk) then subsequent meetings (if needed) directly with Muskoka with a final wrap up 3 way meeting. 

Other trades met with: 
Concepts -- okay and responsive
Emco -- did not carry enough samples to make any kind of decision. Rep was good.
Fireplace centre: waste of time in simply trying to make appointment,  no hours outside 8-4pm and limited availability during 8-4 making appointment next to impossible. We where committed to purchase a fireplace upgrade (Napoleon) but due to this issue we decided to upgrade after rather than chase down contact. 


Frame walk-through:

Daryle Meek is largely responsible as the reason why we purchased a second home from Tamarack. If he was not the site supervisor we would likely have looked elsewhere as his ability to close on time despite issues made the difference. That being said, I was disappointed in the quality of the build that I saw on the walkthough: walls not straight and a floor that was visibly not level at a distance and was a walking hazard, chainsaw cuts though the sub-floor on and sloppy all levels. In my opinion as a former framer I would dismiss the trade responsible outright as I seriously am concerned the finished product will have considerable visible drywall issues and floor level issues on closing that will result in lengthy PDI and resolution before closing.   

               Change: The walkthough did not contain and formal process of documentation and it should. Both with listing items and sign off by parties. 

I can be reached anytime for clarification on the above 613-315-9517.

TAM08191032,"For second appointment with design center, I found that 2.5 hours  is not enough if it is your first time to buy a new house ."
TAM11191025,I wouldn't change anything
TAM0811130,"Considering the Elderly community and the Commitment of Purchasing a new home ( to downscale), many had to sell their properties to be able to Purchase from Tamarack...  I would change the Delays in 'date of possession' for these homes as it adds a great inconvenience to the People who are without homes waiting for this 'date of possession'...
A company such as Tamarack should be better at planning these developments as not to inconvenience people in this manner. 
This greatly tarnishes the purchase experience with Tamarack."
TAM0913112,"The design Center held minimal samples for various items, ie carpet samples, paint samples, edging samples for stone countertop. We found that when we went to these places to preview our items, there were more options as standards, more importantly samples that better suited our tastes. At the point of viewing, it was also too late to change our order due to long administration and fear of a later closing date. It should be brought to the buyers attention that not all samples are available and if they don't see something then direct them to the suppliers themselves."
TAM0313115,"the design centre was not able to explain clearly the options available, introduction interview should be able to explain the next steps to be taken clearly.
last day of slection is to be for 1-2 hrs in time but rep only took 30 mins of her time to finish the last appointment,we felt pressured and the rep was in a hurry to finish the appointment as quickly as possible.
overall experince was ok but the last minute rush at the design centre is like a bad taste and hopefully goes better from here"
TAM1118107,"Everything was done by hand on paper, even scheduling the design center appointments. Had to take time off of work and reschedule dentist appointments because emails were very unresponsive, and the second option was even worse. I would expect a digital calendar where it would be automated, and to be presented with multiple date options at the start, instead of just sending one, and then waiting a week to get a response to change it.

The design center consultant also did things on paper, and took a long time to answer questions, to the point where the options we have selected changed pricing levels by the time she could get us a quote. If it were not on our due diligence to keep track of the options we have selected and the pricing when we selected them, we would have been overcharged due to the fact our consultant took three weeks to get us a quote. I am surprised it cannot all be put into a database, and have the price presented real time as the client is selecting their upgrades.

By contrast, our Muskoka Cabinets representative emailed us back almost immediately and had answers prepared.

At the design center it is also a shock to realize that they don't do everything. For the potlights, Central Vac, Lan/Cable outlets, a separate appointment was necessary with Concept, and there was no visibility between them and the design center. This caused a lot of stress and last minute fixing during the final hours before the deadline to fix things that Concept misplaced/misquoted.

We also booked the first appointment available with each, and it was still a time crunch in the end.

The customer care representative we were told about after signing the contract never once contacted us about the status/schedule of our build. We had to contact her the day after our frame check to voice our concerns officially, and to this day it is still the only form of contact we have.

Lastly, not one person was able to properly describe why I could not have a centered sink in my Cambridge Ensuite. The Meadows Cambridge model home has a centered sink. The sales center there said that it is an older model, but the blueprints he produced stated the sink cannot be centered. Is there revision control on the blueprints? Seems like they can be changed, replaced, and not be able to pull up the old ones. During the frame check they confirmed that it is definitely possible to center the sink. Seems to be a disconnect between the people actually building the homes, and the people selling. A disconnect which cost us about a grand to put in jack and jill sinks.

In summary, I would only recommend Tamarack Homes to other people if they did not care to upgrade anything. The sales center was nice, but the design center experience was the worst experience we have had, when comparing to other friends that have built new homes. One area I can say to improve upon is to computerize the design center experience. And I would have loved to have one appointment where I had both my design center representative and concept in the same room, so there is no question as to what was selected/what is possible."
TAM0413107,It would be great if the design centre could develop an app or something to show you what your home would like like with the options you choose.
TAM0315106,Design center must prepare the final pricing faster so that the customer can check the pricing and make changes as she/he needs.
TAM04182019,"Nothing, you have an amazing team !  Louise, Darlene and Lisa. The team at the design centre is wonderful too.  

Louise's help, friendliness, honesty and flexibility; a major factor in us deciding on tamarack over other builders."
TAM0410119,nothing significantly
TAM0710100,Would not change anything process went very smoothly
TAM0717109,The sales agent was very rude when I brought my realtor in.
TAM08172002,"issues regarding the shower in the ensuite was not dealt with properly and efficiently. We only received a response after the date of our signing. We were told it would cost us an extra $1000 to remove the plastic. The response we received from Tamarack was rude (essentially, accusing us of lying) and came extremely late in the process (after we agreed on our upgrades based on our design). We did not feel that we were properly treated. My understanding is that this was response came directly from HQ, not the design team. The design team was wonderful."
TAM0210117,Less wait. It tooks 1.5 years to get the house.
TAM0716104,"Some of the pricing for upgrades at design centre was too high.
We did some structural changes as well and the pricing was also a bit high on those."
TAM08181026,more info about upgrades in model home.
TAM06171011,We would like to have large touch-screen in Design Center where customers could see interior of entire floor or house with all chosen materials and colors put together. This will speed up design/upgrade process and make overall design selections clear for clients and staff. Providing customers with final printout(s) will help greatly as well.
TAM0412105,"Our experience from start to finish was excellent, the only disappointments we had were in: 1) not being able to make some structural changes that we thought were reasonable but turned out to be architecturally impossible 2) the over pricing of upgrades"
TAM0912107,It was very well presented I would change nothing!
TAM0212100,"I was very disappointed to see that there was no room for negotiations whatsoever. Every other home that I have purchased, the builder has allowed some leeway or has thrown in something as a sign of good will, and that is aside of the bonuses offered. In speaking with your staff, I was told that Tamarack does not budge at all on the prices. I have never experienced this before. To offer something is definately a way to have repeat customers or referrals but to stand rigid on no negotiating at all, is not a sign of customer appreciation. To have something modified slightly by way o few inches and to have to pay for it is something that left me a bit disappointed."
TAM1210121,"- Add wood samples to the sales centre so people can make an informed decision prior to committing to upgrading the staircase. This would provide a clearer picture of the look and feel of what you are buying
- Update the design centre with computer syste"
TAM05181014,"More proactive communication should happen. I am not seeing that. For example, by Feb 23rd Tamarack had to notify me of my firm date with a proper written notice. I did not got anything but i followed up with customer care and they said everything is firm on Feb 26th. After that i received a call in march First week by Sales saying they are sorry but construction is delayed. It is very frustrating when builder does this. I recommended Tamarack to 3 of my friends after i bought my first home but it seems i made a mistake which needs to be rectified. I don't want them to go through same experience like me. Very frustrating!!!!!"
TAM08181004,Design center experience has to step into this century and adopt some technology.  We're asked to make upgrade selections resulting in thousands of dollars without really knowing what the results will look like.  I'm amazed that Tamarack wouldn't have computer software available to make selections and see a preview of what things will look like.   We were told to visit model homes in all your locations to better get a mental idea of what to expect.   This isn't an efficient technique and it's not very accurate unless we were to make the same selections as the models (which we didn't).  It's not fair to ask the buyer to roll the dice on thousands of dollars of upgrades.
TAM0317119,I had an exceptional experience.  I can't say anything bad about it.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.
TAM0516120,none major changes
TAM08171004,Having options to have meetings outside of business hours or on the weekends would have helped us. We found it really hard to take time off work for meetings. The design centre has weekend availability but it would book up quickly.
TAM06191002,It should be mandatory that the salesperson tell the buyer that they cannot put up a fence for a year BEFORE THEY SIGN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.
TAM08181042,"Purchase process - Sales centre staff were welcoming and cheerful.
Deb D was not great to deal with for the agreement. She was pushy, belittling at times, condescending, told me I was stupid, called me a liar, gave us improper information. She ruined the entire process for us, and we almost walked away from the process as a result. We realize these are harsh comments, but feel we needed to pass this along.  You might want to send in a ""secret shopper"" to assess her performance yourself.  We have heard similar stories from others in the community as well.

Design centre - would have been helpful to have a website (We understand options change, but really not difficult to update) or even a digital version of the price catalog. For non standard tile, would have been nice to have even a vague range of what the upgrade cost would be.  To help buyers better estimate upgrade costs, you might also want to consider sharing the costs of the various upgrades in the model homes (so if you like something, you have a sense of what it would cost).
A digital floor plan with room and window dimensions would be nice so we can plan furniture etc. (pdf or even some sort of drawing file we could import into another program would have been amazing).

Build process - Would be nice to have approximate schedule of when things would be completed. 
In an ideal world, a weekly email update on general progress with a couple pictures would have been reassuring and very exciting. 
An email to confirm that our house will be completed on time would have also been nice."
TAM0611127,"Should have more respect for the customer / client. 
Should be client-oriented and not only profit-oriented.
Provide better client service, listen to customer needs and fullfill client demands.
Should respect deadlines and commitments.
Reduce the red-tape and bureaucracy and be more responsive to client needs.
Provide more flexibility to accomodate client requirements even if it is outside the given process and models."
TAM0716111,"The different components in the design centre, the sales centre and the alliance with the Brick, the communication between them could be a lot better."
TAM09191014,More design options and upgrade standars items..
TAM1111102,"- More time and hands on explanations of the options during the structural design phase needed.
- Identify and label all standard vs upgrade options in the model homes.
- Make available detailed floor plans (including reverse ones) from the beginning to"
TAM0510102,design center - long delay to see a representative. took a month for my first appointment with the design center
TAM0213107,Ill let u know when I move
TAM0716107,"100% satisfied with the sales centre experience but totally disappointed by the design centre. I would like to personally talk about it. 

Thanks."
TAM0612123,More time
TAM0216101,"I would like to have had the option of choosing which package of upgrades I would like since I signed within about a month of the change in packages. I would have preferred the granite counter tops, upgraded lighting and smooth ceilings instead of the lump sum amount. The sales staff was adamant that nothing could be done. Also, when I viewed the house I was considering, there were many upgrades that I thought were standard. It was confusing and I felt I should not linger or return to the house to check again. As there was no models available in the city, I visited a house in Chapperal that was occupied and it was difficult to take it all in at once. When I was able to see the new models after I had committed to the house, the options sheets confused me because I thought those would apply to me. It was very disappointing to learn that I was not able to be considered for these upgrades. This was both stressful and disappointing. I felt that once the sale was made I lost value as a customer."
TAM09181010,"Sales centre was excellent Valerie and Darlene we always pleasant and cheerful and and answered a,l concerns, meeting with kitchen designer  Ewa was an extremely positive experience, very professional. We were very happy dealing with her and Muskoka.
The walk through for framing in was brief and a few minor adjustments were needed but overall very good.
The design centre was a very negative and stressful experience.   The first two times we went there to review the options we were there for 
almost  2 hours each time and no one spoke to us and there was no one to answer questions. The hardwood selections are not clearly defined.
During our first appointment, it lasted 20 minutes, we were told any questions had to be answered during our second appointment by the designer and we were slept walked through the options.  The second appointment we had to have everything chosen in order for the designer to record it.  We had done extensive home work and running around to all four ceramic showrooms to understand the tile costs, and thought that if we hadn’t we wouldn’t have been very stressful.  When I asked about fire place mantles we were referred the the fireplace centre that we found out after driving out there that they only deal with inserts. At the end of the second appointment there were still questions and pricing and was told to go back to Euro ceramic on our own time.
We spent $30,000 in upgrades and the custom pricing was all over the place and made no sense. And we questioned it. In our final appointment to sign off, again no assistNce with choices we were told by our designer the message from head office was for us to stop asking about prices.  As a result we chose standard options for our Ensuite.  We had requested to have a $5.50 sq ft tile priced and the tub deck alone came back at $4000.  Not to mention how crazy the floor and shower were.  In the main bath shower for a glass border the price was $110 in the Ensuite shower where there is less tile double the price for the same tile. The kitchen backsplash at $15.00 per sq foot was $1200 when we questioned these costs we told the builder had to make a profit.  None of this exaggerated and the process finished a few months ago so we are now calm about how frustrating the design centre process is. It was the polar opposite of the sales centre where we have always been professionally treated.  At the design centre we would walk in sit down and wait because no one was at reception and would have to greet the receptionist when she came back to the desk because she would not look at us."
TAM04182030,"The cost of upgrades is shocking.  Clearly explaining how they came to that sales number for the upgrades.  You think to yourself, why is this so high compared to normal market price.  This was something that concerned me."
TAM0811111,"Exact pricing calculations were not explained. For the taxes, (which are fairly substantial), we were only given a number; no explanation. The receptionist told us different tax rates were used for various price brackets, or something...  We ended up just signing the contract because we were tired and fed up. However, it was frustrating to be handed a contract, asked to sign off on a huge amount of money, without anyone with knowledge of the financial details to answer our questions. Other than that, the rest of the process was quite enjoyable."
TAM05181024,"It would have been very helpful to have seen our model,the Oriole."
TAM0212103,"The sale and design process were good, it would be nice if the sales team up front had more information regarding cost of upgrades as it would have provided me with better insight as to what I could have purchased, knowing up front what upgrades I wanted for the most part."
TAM05191015,"The design center experience.
Giving customers more cost reasonable options.
Being more competitive with the base features of the home in comparison to other builders"
TAM0510137,"nothing..We had excellent experiences with both..However, the design centre is VERY, VERY, backed up thus is took us several weeks to get in.  That being said...Kim Knuth was EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
TAM1114109,N/A
TAM08191016,"On Friday April 5th we choice our kitchen selection  2 tone color and on Sunday April 7th we changed our mind and emailed advising we decided to change the island color.      No sure, if the person was on vacation or holiday but they tried to make the changes however final decision maker Debbie Champagne would not authorize our change.  This had left a sour taste in our mouth and are very disappointed.   We tried escalate in an email everyone from Sales Staff to décor coordinator tried to help with our issue but was denied.   We purchased to homes from Tamarack and we are disappointed with this issue."
TAM1111109,"Yes, if I could, it would be to change the manager i dealt with at the sales office.  He was unable to modify any of my requests regarding my dwelling (although he claimed he was authorized to do so), i.e. replacing the front glass door to a solid door, replacing the tankless hot water heater with a storage tank, etc."
TAM0210125,More on what to expect during the construction. A more clear picture in regards to the upgrades and costs vrs the standards.
TAM1213114,"Nothing, I think its perfect!!!!"
TAM04191028,"I can't think of anything right now.  Sorry.
I had a good experience during the all process and hope to keep it that way.
Thank you!"
TAM10181011,"Selection of structural upgrades should be an exhaustive selection options list the same as your exterior colour sections procedure. Your design centre agent would be empowered if you built them a CadKey based computer design tool to more effectively convey what selection options would look like. A more direct question, progress, answer, history tracking approach to managing your client’s process, concerns, communications and issue tracking is recommended - plenty of affordable CRM products available to do that in an integrated manner with your clients. I have plenty of recommendations and proposed solutions. Happy to discuss further if desired."
TAM10171005,Nothing
TAM03191001,"I was and am still not pleased with the external colours of my Drake. I brought this to Noella’s attention several times and she said nothing could be done. 

I questioned this since the materials had not been applied when I first expressed my concern. 

This issue has put a bit of a damper on my enthusiasm with regards to my purchase."
TAM0715104,"It would be useful to have the information in French.
Not too much opening to modifications of the design."
TAM05181015,I would want more time to go through the design centre process.
TAM10171023,I wouldn't change anything about it.
TAM1016118,the furnace was never hooked up prior to moving in.  Everyone from sales team did amazing .
TAM10191003,"As far as the design centre process, the meetings are not long enough with the Muskoka designer as well as the Tamarack designer.  Also it would be nice to allow more time between the meetings for us to decide the colours & upgrade.  The 3 meetings were booked in a way that didn't follow the documentation we received (# of weeks).  After I asked they did allow me more time.
As for the sale, the sales rep. did put my name on her calendar for a specific closing date & when I showed up for signature, the contract had a different date.  She ended up changing the date on the contract back to the date we agreed on, so it turned out ok.  But now, I just received a Delay notice from Tamarack saying they won't be able to deliver my house on the closing date stated in the contract.  I am very disappointed in Tamarack because they don't respect the closing date.  My current house is sold, & I will need to move out of my house most likely before taking possession of the new one.  I will be homeless & will probably need to put all my belongings in storage.  Most likely Tamarack will deliver a 2nd Delay notice.  This is very stressful for us the customer, selling our house & not being able to move into the new house because Tamarack don't honor the closing date.  Compensation is ridiculous & certainly not enough for the stress of being homeless + all the dollars spent on accomodation, meals & storage.  Very disappointed with Tamarack."
TAM0214105,none
TAM0313109,It would be nice to be able to view some of our options online so we didn't have to keep going back to the design center and have to juggle between their working hours and ours.
TAM1012123,"Our only hiccup in the process was the excessive price increase in cabinetry finishes right before our deadline to select them.  We also found that communication with the design centre was slow in that, when urgent decisions were to be made, we were only contacted by e-mail instead of trying to reach us by phone as well.  It slowed things down."
TAM1011112,"be sure designers know what type of structural changes can be made especially in the kitchen and ensure that the changes meet building codes and sound building practices.

kitchen designs with structural changes should be done first before customer is asked to sign off the structural component in the purchase agreement contract."
TAM10191013,"the choices we have to make before going in, not enough options. The choices made for the neighborhood. Someone pays for $700,000 should have the right to choose what they want on the exterior."
TAM0512110,Nothing. All is good.
TAM1015104,Communication between agents -  they contacts 2 times several times for the same information because they didnt communicate between themselves that things were completed.  Doesnt give me confidence in the facts that situations were taken care of.
TAM0313124,"One Saturday morning I was trying to reach the design centre by phone as I had forgotten some important documents there after my last visit.  Although the design centre was open as it was after 9 a.m. I could not reach the receptionist directly.  I had the option of leaving a voicemail for one of the designers or leaving it on the general mailbox.  I called several times over the course of 3 hours and was not able to speak to a ""live"" person.  Neither was my voicemail returned by the receptionist.  It was very frustrating.  I ended up going in to the centre in person.  It would be nice for the receptionist to actually answer the phone and have real-time communication when she is present."
TAM10181020,Perhaps have more help when just browsing. I felt that I could not ask any questions when I did not have an actual appointment.  I also felt a bit rushed when I met the designer - it is as if not enough time is scheduled even though I was very prepared.  Designer was amazing.  Loved the Muskoka rep as well.
TAM01201008,"I normally would like to give suggestions here however, I believe you have it bang on. One thing I would strongly suggest is you should ensure that your Roger's guy and electrician have the plan from the sound place....concept design I believe it's called. During the framing walk through I noticed a plug and internet outlet that were supposed to be beside each other were not. Anyone that was installing it should have realized they should be next to each other. (Hopefully this is fixed for my final walkthrough). I would like to note also that for my framing walkthrough, I would have gave the guy (sorry I forgot his name) a 10. He was great, the only problem was that he was new to Tamarack and I really wanted to speak with our Forman. We brought up several concerns at the walkthrough and never heard back. It would be nice to be given updates on our concerns."
TAM09171004,"Better communication via e-mail to get answers especially after the walk through, a quicker reply on questions. More time to allow changes after the walk through. More inspections/walk through for cutomers who wish. 2 upgrades that are on my list have yet to be done and don't know if they willl...They have been added to my final price but have not been done. A pot light in the main level shower and a reenforced electrical outlet for future ceiling fan in living room. I requested both before the drywall was installed. 
On a positive side I really enjoyed ""working"" with Joy and Mandy (who seemed to enjoy spending my money a little too much, haha!!!)"
TAM0216103,The cost of all the upgrades are exaggerated (design phase). I would make them more realistic to standards of someone purchasing their products.
TAM03191011,"Post sale process was rough for us. We bought an early occupancy with the pseudo promise of a nearly firm close date of November... as long as we kept on track of our design choice timelines. We did our end of our agreement. Met all timelines... even in the midst of a third pregnancy and the loss of our father. 

However, we ended up getting bumped back into March!!! Not ok when we bought this new build with the expectation to move in and settled before baby #3 arrives in February. 

Now I am pregnant, expecting baby #3, living out of boxes (because I really can't pack with a newborn in tow) and move/settle with a 1 month, 4 year old and 5 year old. 

Very disappointed with the lack of urgency on our early occupancy close."
TAM11191027,"Pricing was difficult to figure out. Everyone's time is valuable and we didn't feel like we could ask for pricing for a lot of things due to time constraints, we had to limit our choices to 1 or 2 options. We may have gone with different options (tiles) if we new right away how much it would have cost without waiting a few days for a quote.    Also some things in the catalogue need more explanation. Consider adding more information online, perhaps an FAQ."
TAM0615100,"none, all meetings were professional and ready."
TAM10171012,Match the promotions with tartans
TAM0311115,I likely would have inquired about options/upgrades that needed to be bought at the sales centre (ex.  changing the front door).  We would have made an appointment with the pluming supplier in order to see more upgrade sections.
TAM0212118,"Our sales and design process was very smooth and all the Staff we dealt with was very knowledgeable and helpful with our design choices.
Valerie Taller and Kim Knuth made this experience very exciting and we were able to enjoy every step of it."
TAM12181003,very good as it is
TAM03182009,Nothing.
TAM0316106,Nothing.  Both were great.
TAM0811131,"Window well was dented in. Also, drywall was up prior to my meeting, so, I couldn't really review."
TAM0317112,"A larger sales or design centre. The tile section should be better displayed and grouped by style, colour, etc. Design centre should also display standard lighting packages as this has a large impact on the design. Items unavailable to customize our home to our needs. Such as cold storage, stairs on patio with walkout,and hinge door stoppers.

The Design centre process can be stream lined with bar codes and scanners to give the buyer pricing/print out of choices. The sales centre could also have an application to enter your choices within your home. Similar to the kitchen design. This gives the buyer more confidence in their selections."
TAM0913110,"Overall the business is good.  Some of the things didn't seem fair.  When you are taking something out and just replacing it with something else, to charge so much, didn't seem fair."
TAM0613102,We were not able to visit a model home prior to purchasing.
TAM0416111,"Nothing - was fantastic throughout. Special props to Deborah Denison - who worked closely with us from beginning to end. She was especially attentive to us as first time home buyers, and provided honest feedback to our questions. I'd recommend her, and Tamarack, to anyone looking to buy."
TAM06161007,Nothing at all.
TAM0310107,"Everything went smoothly at both centres, it may not be feasible but having both centres together would be very convenient."
TAM06171024,Have more options for paint colours. It's too expensive to change colour even slightly from standards. Colours make houses unique so they all don't look the same. Selection staff can assist clients who have a hard time choosing.
TAM1016119,nothing
TAM12171009,Have more standard modern features
TAM0712113,I would change the way things were handled when we were told one thing with the sales rep then Concepts advised us differently. Eventually we had to fix things on our own when all it took was a simple phone call from the sales rep and not 12 emails that were exchanged.
TAM09191028,"No idea, 
Regarding color  it should have given us more options without upgrades. 
Hardwood also without upgrades."
TAM08181028,"water heater should be optional, monthly fee is too expensive and buy-out price of $4000+ is absurd for a $1400 unit.  The sales team is exceptional, and design team is very knowledgeable. The percentage of mark up on upgrades puts a sour note on a great sales and design team."
TAM0213119,"It would be great to have a web-based ""account"" set up where you could log in and track everything to do with your new home. From the model choice to upgrades selected, the ever fluctuating cost, electronic documents, pictures and sample images of flooring, siding and everything else you have chosen, etc. One could make selections (or at least have a general idea) at their leisure in the comfort of their home before actually visiting the design centre."
TAM1012120,I would change the standard options at the design centre as most are outdated.  A more reasonable price for upgrades would be appreciated as we found out many prices where double in price.
TAM0613121,"- sufficient time during design centre appointment for decision making
- there would be less hussles if we could deal with one party (the design center) in stead of going to various suppliers to complete the process (e.g. kitchen design from Muskoka, Potlight&alarm from Concept home, more selection of flooring and plumbing, etc)
- selection of hardwood flooring for the Meadows was limited. We could only choose Mirage products which does not provide enough variety.
- It would be more helpful if we could have more than one appointment with our kitchen designer."
TAM0412120,We are very happy with the people we met and the process you have.
TAM0711119,"First, we should note that we are about 7 weeks away from closing so our comments only relate to what we have expereinced so far.  Overall, the experience has not been too bad.  There were some challenges as well as positives.  

On the down-side, our first experience with the Design Centre was far from pleasant.  When we first arrived there, we were admonished by the Receptionist for showing up without an appointment, despite guidance from the sale staff to do so given the tight timeline we had to view and then select upgrades with the designer. It was only after we nearly walked out with the thought of cancelling the sale that the receptionist quickly changed her tone.  Not the best first impression.  She did try a little harder later on.

Perhaps the one item that bothers us most is the limited Customer Care support.  While were pleased to receive a nice Welcome Letter from Tamarack that talked about the very special purchase we had made and the commitment by the Customer Care Representative to provide us regular feedback on our construction, we feel somewhat let down by this promise since noone has proactively tried to contact us and provide updates.  Nor have they, in particular the Customer Care Representative, been quick to reply to any of our emails or in some cases not yet.  As we currently live out of province, we, more than most other customers, rely on the Customer Care support for updates and accomodations where possible.  We haven't been exceptionally well served here.  In fact, we are still waiting for feedback on the construction process and help with establishing a pre-delivery inspection date.  Leaves us wondering how important the 'Care' is in Customer Care.  As for our Sales Rep, Noella Francoeur and Designer, Kim Knuth, both have been very helpful.  We appreciate their commitment.

We have worked diligently with our designer and the sales staff to make decisions in a quick and orderly way to allow Tamarck as much time to get on with construction.  We have been patient clients, but feel the sentiment has not necessarily been returned in kind as promised.  We are hopeful this changes and that the house will be completed on time and with the care and professionalism Tamarack prides itself upon.  We believe in Tamarack, but we need Tamarack to believe in us to truly make this a positive experience!

Kind regards,    

Rick and Linda Pitre"
TAM0111109,"Clearing plans with city before releasing units for sale.

Having most upgrades not factor into the savings of not installing the standard - for example, why would I have to pay full price for granite when Tamarack is saving the cost/labor of the laminate installation. We would have purchased more in upgrades from Tamarack if they were less expensive then we could get elsewhere.

A better way to visualize what our design choices would look like in the finished product."
TAM0711101,"We were quite happy overall.
Jacqueline was great, and Tera has been fantastic for any follow ups, having taken over the sales position in Greenwood Park.  The sales process was good.
Mike runs a pretty tight ship, and we've been impressed with his efficiency and responsiveness.
Selections were somewhat of a struggle, Carolyn wasn't as organized as everyone else we encountered, but we got through.  We're very excited to see the finished product.

TAM1115113,Black window frames from the outside and more upgrade bonus
TAM0915126,"Finished basement should come with all houses. :)
Can't wait to move in!!"
TAM0412115,I had a great  experience with the sales staff and the Design centre. What at team approach indeed. The only thing I was disappointed in was the option of the style of the house that became the regular style and I was not told that at the onset and was unable to get what I wanted. I am happy with the home in general and have been back to see the progress since. The contractor (project engineer) was very helpful and accommodating to us. Thank you Tamarack for such a wonderful experience.
TAM0612100,Nothing the sales and design center staff have been amazing. We could not have asked for a better experience from Deborah in chaperal and Kim in the design center. The are the reason tamarack has a great reputation
TAM1110122,"It is very stressful to buy a house, especially when it is your first house. Having a lot of pressure to sign off for the house is somewhat difficult to manage. I would have appreciated less pressure at the sales centre.

I was very pleased with my experience at the design center. I would not change anything. I had good feedback and was able to visit the design center many times to choose all my samples."
TAM05191000,"Quail Home at Cardinal Creek

1. Be more flexible with the client for the design, for example, we wanted a niche in the shower (to put shampoo and soap)... Your answer: we don't do that. We would like to have some pocket doors: Your Answer: No we don't do that... We would like to have a rough in for a future fireplace (gas insert): No we can't do that... and the list goes on... We were clearly told and explained that this was not a ""Custom Home""... 
2. When it comes to push back the delivery date... be more ""human"" about the communication... and not send it 2 days before Christmas... A pre formatted letter was sent to us pushing back our delivery date from April 11, 2019 to May 31rst... without a mention about how sorry you were or we understand how much problems this can cause... I have sent you letter about this very very unfortunate situation... Please refer to my file if you would like to read it... and by the way... we received an acknowledgement of this letter that we sent you weeks after us sending it... which is totally unacceptable... in these days of instant messaging... 
3. Be more organized with a better communication between contractors and management... for example: we were told that our home was delayed because of a building permit... while our home was already build and had a roof on it... 

Feel free to contact us regarding this experience."
TAM06171005,"Be more aware of the electrical, cable and bell outlet are situated otherwise every was perfect up to now."
TAM1011110,"So far we like dealing with the complete team at Tamarack. It has been an easy process.Your construction staff Vic , the exceptionel sales person Noella, Kim at the design center everybody are nice and easy to deal with. I would not change any thing,the chemistry seems to be pretty good."
TAM0313103,"Fair upgrade prices, that would make me buy tamarack again.  Not to be forgotten for the structural.  Not sure if we received the right prices."
TAM0517105,"Would have been useful to have an on-site model of the home we were interested in.  However, full marks to the staff for arranging a viewing of an occupied model at another location. That sealed the deal."
TAM1114105,Perhaps have your salesperson walk through the model unit with potential customers.
TAM0911132,Ensure the sales center has the most recent catalogue for updates to hand over so clients have time to review prior to meeting with design centre. Ensure the design center gives the client the appropriate catalogue pertaining to the appropriate unit purchased. Ensure all upgrades are costed out and none left with 0.00 dollars. Ensure the designers are informed on upgrades (ie: upgrade offered for walk in shower enclosure and pivot style doors in lieu of sliders). Our frame walk thru is scheduled for next week so some questions have been left unanswered.
TAM01171003,"Standardize the colour of the dots on all products so that you can easily identify which products are standard and what level of upgrades other products are.  They were not consistent.  As well, we found some of the upgrades to cupboard materials and paint options confusing until explained by the representative."
TAM0511122,We would recommend a virtual tour to assist the selection process in the Design Center; that way all home buyers can get a *better* idea how their house it's going to look like.
TAM0915122,"Valerie and Margaret are a very  kind and professional sales person but it would be better for the company to have a bilingual staff specially in the design centre. In addition, I'm upset with the lady who is charge of the head office because instead of beeing helpful, she judged me by writing that I'm anxious when I told her that I like to change the type of my tiles just 2 days after having submitted my request..."
TAM0911118,The group at the sales centre are so convivial it was always a joy to visit.  I learned there was a watercolour group in our development which I will join - if it had been possible I would like to have sat and had some tea and chatted but my son was always waiting in the car.
TAM0410112,"The biggest problem we have had was that we were only given a day of notice to get a home inspector. We called every home inspector in the Ottawa area and they were all booked. We were not able to get an inspector for the day of our walk through. Our sales rep said that this was not her fault, that it was head office calling that late. As a customer, it does not matter whose fault it is. It matters that as the customer we receive adequate time to find a home inspector for us. We were also told that we would not be given more than a week warning of when we will need a home inspector for our final home inspection. This is not acceptable. You cannot just tell a home inspector that you will need their services at some point during a certain week, they need ample time to schedule the appointment, not last minute as Tamarack informs their customers.  Other than this everything else has been satisfactory."
TAM0812116,"""The sales process was excellent.  Louise and Darlene were wonderful to deal with; returned phone calls/emails promptly; explained things very clearly etc.  We received pricing for our structual upgrades promptly.

We were less impressed with our design centre experience.  I had spent a lot of time at the design centre before our appointments (and appreciated that I was able to do so) which I think helped tremendously.  We appreciated the options catalogue for our model - this took a lot of guesswork out of the process and I wish other builders would adopt this approach.  It really sets Tamarack apart, in my opinion.  

We were disappointed at the lack of selection, particularly for standard bathroom wall tiles and kitchen backsplash tiles.  We visited many tile suppliers on our own.  We asked for pricing for several tiles, and waited a long time for this information (we only received it a couple of days before our final appointment).  Had we received this information earlier, we could have asked for pricing on alternate tiles.  In addition, some of the pricing we received made us reconsider our other selections so in the end we felt very rushed.

Some of the upgrade pricing we received made absolutely no sense.  Tiles that had the same per foot square price as standard tiles came back with wildly different prices.  We paid $900 to tile 2 walls of a shower in a tile that cost $6 per square foot (in addition to the $3200 charge to have a tiled shower!).  If we questioned the cost of an upgrade, we were told 'that's the price'.  We wanted to upgrade part (not all) of our bannister in oak - we were quoted a price that was more than replacing the entire railing in maple.  It made absolutely no sense.  Railing upgrade pricing did not take account of the fact that we replaced part of the railing with a half wall.  We eventually grew frustrated and decided to do some of our upgrades after closing.

The alarm system pre-wire was also not a pleasant experience.  Tamarack required us to use one supplier.  We wanted to use Concept Homes who was doing our potlights and central vac but were told we could not.  We did not care for the alarm system rep at all - her 'sales technique' was total fear mongering (in fact, she gives a fairly negative impression of the area that you're moving into which probably isn't Tamarack's intention).  She also did not offer a pre-wire option only - you had to purchase the system through them and have it monitored with them (at a rate which is higher than what we pay currently).  As a result, we did not get a pre-wire done and will have to do it after we close, which is inconvenient.

Ewa at Muskoka kitchens was a dream to deal with - she was definitely the highlight of our design centre experience.  The communication between the design centre and Muskoka could definitely be better - we often received stuff from Ewa because the design centre hadn't forwarded it to us."""
TAM1013101,"When doing upgrades process, it was trouble to have to go to the specific store since the centre did not have the sample."
TAM0915121,The designer should manage custom items instead of sending to a different providers to get the pricing.
TAM0611104,I would not change a thing! We are very pleased with the professionalism that we have recieved from Deborah (Chaperal) and Kim (Sales Centre).  They both have been very kind and helpful with any concerns or questions that we have had.  Please ensure that this message gets relayed to the president and owner of the company because these two ladies should be recognized for their hard work and dedication!
TAM1110117,"re:Walk thru. That has NOT taken place. Personel were pleasant BUT ....I'm perplexed by what is written and not done. I was to receive a letter re: start of construction ~ not rec'd. I asked about landscaping... sales person couldn't find/have design plan. Told to look at what is out there on existing homes.At the  !st mtg. w/ design person which started late,she gave me 10 min. warning that she  had to stop exactly @ 12 noon as she had to go home to walk her dog.At exactly 12 she said ... I've got to go! ( In my professional career you don't 'shut down' until the CLIENT is satisfied w/the outcome.) During the mtg.I chose cabinet colour and flooring... from that point on all selections had vered to  very brown tones.  I felt rushed! I went back on my own, reviewed and  re-did the majority of my selections changing my focus to more of a cream based theme. Given the 45 days from purchase signing to seal the up-grades et al I had been given an initial date at about day 90 I specifically ashed if that was too late ..No BUT I did get an earlier appt. when Chantel made a change to someone else. I believe I was assigne a 'point person'  who was to make contact and keep me  abreast of developments. That has not  happened! I drive by the site and nothing appears to have has taken place in the last 3 weeks. I have concerns about  the time line and my occupancy date??? This is my 6th new home purchase and I've found it to be a very 'bumpy ride'! Bottom line ... CHANGE = improve the communication."
TAM0312101,The design centre experience was fine but considering the overall cost of the home I believe that the buyer should be provided with small sample of hardwood chosen and carpet in the same way counter top sample are.
TAM0611118,"For the Sales Process -- if someone wants to buy a lot in a new release and wants to put money down on it, we were irritated with the first come first serve basis on release day.  We ended up waiting in the cold (February release) all day in line with one other person to purchase a lot that we could have showed up at 4 or 5pm to buy the same lot.  A little irritating especially if you are a serious buyer.  We were also led to believe that there was going to be a huge waiting line; we think you should change this method where serious buyers can pre-purchase a waiting line place with a downpayment or something of that nature...

For the Design Center Process -- we kept asking if the upgrades we were getting were 'normal' (similar to other people); we were asking not to curb our choices but so we could be ready to expect delays (which we had because of permit issues with the city) or with the inspection building process (for example, in our pre-drywall we found that the standard counter was being built where we had completely upgraded the kitchen) -- 

In both cases we don't know if it was to 'keep the sale' -- but to quote a movie - the model home 'had us at Hello' -- we were totally committed to  buying and upgrading our version of the home and just couldn't understand why the sales and design staff still seemed wary of our intentions...  a little odd"
TAM0412122,"More time to make selections should be provided, given that you can spend a significant amount of the time between second and final apt. waiting to get quotes."
TAM10171020,"Process is good. Price for upgrades is way too high. In some instances, the profit margin on upgrades were in the range of 30 to 50%. The consumer will do much more upgrades is the margins were more reasonable, anywhere between 10-20% instead."
TAM0114100,"1. More model displays. 
2. Software to play with fixtures, cabinets, flooring, doors etc
3. More detail overview of area and property at sales centre. Details for first time new home buyers."
TAM06161012,"My wife and I waived our conditions for the purchase of the house on the 6th of March and during that time Jacqui stated that we had until the 24th to finalize our selections for the design centre. This seemed like an adequate amount of time to have 3 appoinments to pick our selections. The Design Centre Rep was unprepared on 2 out of the 2 appointments. During the first appointment Carolyn stated that her printer was broken and the ceiling of the basement which had all of the design options was being worked on so we could not go down there. My wife and I were upset because she could have called us prior to the appoint and rescheduled for a better time when she and the centre were ready. We were there for less than an hour. We arranged for a babysitter to watch our 2 kids during this time. At the beginning of the second appointment she advised that since we are so far behind we will have to schedule a third appointment which would push back our close date. She explained that it is not her fault becuase after we pick our cabinets, counter tops, adn related items, she will have to send them to a third party and that would up to a week to get back to her. This made me fraustraed because we could have picked these items at the inital meeting simply by bringing some of the sample upstairs or by reschedling for a day or two later. This would have given the third party more time. This was unacceptable since my wife and I had already sold our house based on the close date agreed upon with Jacqui. At the same time another customer arrived and Carolyn asked my wife and I to go in the basement and look around. I felt that she may have double booked herself further indicating her unpreparedness. Because of what Carolyn said about our close date, I told her that we must pick all our selections today in order to meet the close date. This was not ideal for us because my wife was 6 months pregnant at the time and we ended up spending 3+ hours at the design centre. The overall design centre experience was very rushed and very frustrating."
TAM03191018,"I suggest to have a colored photocopier/scanner at the design center, all documents were photocopied in black and white, bad ink, legal size paper instead of letter size, it will be good to have a colored copy on the spot when you sign any document. The basement slope is not good, I discovered this issue when the contractor finished the basement and was raining, when trying to inform the site manager he argued with me that I can't be on site, too late now. some details that you can see when picking up the staff for the house for example a new toilet paper roll doesn't fit in the roll holder, just discover last 2 weeks when the ambient temperature went up that the front door paint is sticky and can easily be scratched. ...."
TAM0510142,A guaranteed possession date.  A more clear understanding about costs not available at beginning such as extras and structural changes and taxes.
TAM0517114,"A suggestion is to provide an e-mail outlining the components (e.g., types of discussions and decisions) of each design centre meeting.  At times it wasn't as systematic as my personality would have liked!"
TAM1015126,customer has right
TAM01201021,N/A
TAM1016102,Take more time
TAM1016105,"Your designers at the Design Centre would benefit greatly from having an application that brings together all selections made with your suppliers (Mondeau, Conceptt Home Theatre, etc.). Having to retype everything is a waste of their time, and takes time away from their clients (you don't get to see too many people using white-out these days, but your designers have to use it quite a bit!)  Like Justin Trudeau would say: This is 2016!!!  I would push further by Tamarack making available to purchasers an on-line catalogue (showing upgrade items with prices and photos) so we can make a first draft of selections before we meet the deisgner for the first time.  I did that myself on an Excel spreadhseet using your paper catalogue but this would be more efficient for all with an on-line catalogue. I would love to be part of your User Acceptance Testing should you decide to go ahead with such an on-line catalogue. ;-)"
TAM0211100,"Everything was great.  All representatives were very knowledge, accomodating, considerate and kind.  Everything about this experience has been very satisfying and I was a little scared.....being the first time doing this on my own.  I felt I wasn't alone, others understood my concerns and took the time to reassure me and to provide valuable advice........which I greatly apprciated.  I would highly recommend your company to anyone and my brother works for another company and even he was impressed.  The only thing I would change is to give the buyer more time when they go in for upgrade selection.  I could have used much more time here but....other than that it was great."
TAM0510128,need more time at the design centres
TAM0613111,The overall experience has been great! Everyone has been extremely pleasant and helpful when I had questions. I would definitely recommend Tamarack to all my friends and family. I did have a bit of a hard time getting in contact with one of the suppliers however it was over the Christmas holidays which was understandable. As a first time home buyer I am extremely happy with my home purchase and I feel very confident in the builder. The whole process has been very smooth and exciting!
TAM12191015,Nothing
TAM1210116,The sales and design center were OK.  The only issue was that we didn't have choice for the date/time (1pm or 1:30pm) for the inspection and because of that neither my wife nor I were able to attend.  We personally think that this is an important step in the process and having been denied any kind of date/time change wasn't really professional.  A little flexibility should be allowed.
TAM0714105,Provie a bit more time to review the rich upgrade selections.
TAM1112131,"It would be nice if the design bonus has the prices of the upgrades instead of always having to price it and come back and calculate it.  If everything was stream lined and if we can just pick what upgrades we would like and sign the upgrade papers afterwards.  Instead of multiple visits to the design center.  I personally think the design process is confusing and would greatly improve if a price list of upgrades were available readily like the other builders.

Our friend referred us but we are still not able to get the referral bonus which is a minus."
TAM0615114,"Because I was working within a budget, nothing."
TAM04171021,"Sales Centre: I would not change much. Everything is well laid out and properly indicated. The team at the sales office for the Meadows is very knowledgeable about Tamaracks homes, products being offered and options for potential buyers. We have worked with Deb and Mike in the past and enjoyed working with them again, and hopefully in the near future!

Design Centre: The Layout of the centre (on St. Laurent) was on the best. I have to yet to visit the new location. Materials for each individual neighbourhood was not properly distinguished in the centre. Perhaps having dedicated areas for each build site with finishes that are not common to all would be better. We found it very confusing since everything was mixed together."
TAM1109116,"With the design center a lot of prices were posted or in the database. However some of the updates did require time. Plus with Muskoka, the process gets lengthy waiting for quote. If the price quote of all the major upgrades are in house the process would be more faster"
TAM0911124,"The sales process went well, but the design process was difficult.  I think the staff should be able to assist more with interior selections.  Most buyers are not educated in design and would benefit from a proffessional opinion.  The standards, upgades and availabilities should be organised better to avoid confusion and dissappointment.  We had to change our selections multiple times because one item was not available.

Also,I think there should be a Muskoka representative in Kingston or Tamarak should consider using a Kingston company.  We were unable to travel to Ottawa and this made the kitchen process much more difficult than it should have been."
TAM10191014,Wouldn’t change anything specific.
TAM0610143,"Increase number of design consultants to avoid backlog.  The delay with the design centre forced a push back of our closing date.  Because of this we felt rushed to make our design centre choices to avoid further delaying of our closing date.
Change layout of design centre.  We found it very difficult to navigate through all the different choices especially standard vs upgrade."
TAM04171004,To have access to upgrade prices before purchasing the house.
TAM1213118,"do another walk through when fixes are done after first frame check
I am very disappointed that my lot 34P did not meet my expectation when it come to ceiling"
TAM10171014,"Sales:

The sales representatives were not thoroughly knowledgeable and because of that we currently have issues with our contract. They gave us a lot of mixed information."
TAM0512116,"Nothing, it was great! The sales team were fantastic!"
TAM0415105,I am extremely happy with the service from the sales and design centre.
TAM0913111,"The Sales at FC are amazing won't change anything about it, best team in Ottawa, I have been to other builders and they don't even come close to the level of welcome and hospitality.
Design center could be more responsive, maybe it was a bad luck that they were on extended vacations during my design time, and answers kept bouncing from different people, and I had to keep a list of what is answered and what not cause my requests were either lost or misunderstood.
Also I found it difficult that I have to sign of on all structural changes with no knowledge of how much my design center upgrades would cost, so I went ahead with a lot of construction changes then got shy with my budget when I discovered the prices for the DC upgrades and had to cut corners on what to upgrade.
All in all it was a very positive experience and I already recommended Tamarack to 2 of my friends who are buying homes :)
Thanks."
TAM04191001,"Nothing. You and your staff are doing an excellent job. Keep up the good work! But please keep on top of it. Do not become complacent. As a developer you have a great name and reputation. Your entire team must constantly strive to maintain and improve your reputation. 
What buyers like us really appreciate is (1) honesty, and (2) transparency. So far this has been the case in our dealings with Tamarack Homes. Please keep it up.
Thank you.
Vern and Ginette Phillips."
TAM02171003,I hope I can win a survey.  Thank you
TAM0513107,"I would ask for the ""standards"" to be more in keeping with ""standard"" expectations.  NOBODY uses some of the standards that are on offer.  They are so outdated, ie. toilet roll holder wall insert.  
I would have expected the cost of the granite counter to include the cut out for the sink. How could anyone buy a counter without cutting for the sink?  Some of these charges seem over the top."
TAM12191017,nothing
TAM02171008,"Wish there was an interactive tool (like a computer program or app) where you could select items from the design centre and see how they would actually look in the home. 

Also wish we knew that a fan and thermostat were not provided with the fireplace, and that the option to get this was not even available.

Overall, everything has been fantastic though!"
TAM0909115,Ensure that the prices listed on the option catalogue should not be subjected to change after signing the purchase agreement. More than 3 meeting's at the design centre.
TAM0316108,A little more guidance when making design selections.  We were left to ourselves and would have appreciated a little bit more input and suggestions.
TAM0713110,"We have done everything wihin a few days in Kingston and mainly communicated at distance.  I would say that having all selections correcly priced and available on a list prior to sit with design ofice and after we did our section would have helped.  Also, understanding what is standard and what is not could be more explicit; probably victim of lack of time here.  In general, the staff was amazing and the quality of the work is there."
TAM05191002,"We found both centres to be very accommodating in answering our questions.
Have dealt with Noella Francoeur, Joy Kerr and Joyce Newman whom all went the extra mile to help with our questions.
The main item that we were disappointed in was that we asked all these people as well as Paul the foreman that had us visit the house at the stud stage to have an air vent in the Kitchen somewhere which was refused.  The Basement Family Room plan shows an air vent near the window - there is none in our house.  There is only one vent in the whole room at one end.  The room is about 21"" long and we believe this is not enough.  Would not want Tamarack to have to come in later to put in an air duct because it is too cold.  We would appreciate that this problem be corrected before any carpet be installed in that room and of course before we move in.  Please respond to this concern.
You have been in this business long enough to know what works and what doesn't, therefore, please keep up the good work in building this great little community of Cardinal Creek Village.  It has been a pleasure.  Thank you, Michel and Diane Seguin"
TAM1115102,I can't answer that because the upgrades were already done for this house.
TAM01201027,"The design centre process felt as though we were an inconvenience when we were communicating by email.  I think the design centre may be understaffed - we were mostly dealing with the same person as during our first purchase, but the experience was different.  When we purchased as Tamarack 5 years ago, the process was seamless and we very much felt welcome.  This time, I hesitated to reach out, because I knew our questions would be returned with passive-aggressive or minimizing responses.  When there in person though, it was a very welcoming and an enjoyable experience."
TAM0511102,Wine & cheese will be nice :)
TAM0911114,More options in the design center.  Easier than going to each vendor to view more samples.
TAM06191003,"...that our builder, Tamarack had met the first closing date. As seniors, it is very upsetting to have to move our belongings twice and costly as well. Otherwise, it has been a great experience so far. Thanks to Joy , Noella and Mandy at the design center!"
TAM1209102,"The sales team was extremely knowledgeable and hard working as was the decorating center staff.
It was a challege to get our decorating centre meeting dates. We did not have a blue print meeting but that is alright. When we had initial appointment booked to do the purchase, we had to wait to the point of almost not being able to keep the appointment.
A neighbourhood block party / meet your neighbour bar-b-que was hosted by the sales team. This was a great event and much appreciated."
TAM12171010,I am not sure about that
TAM0612107,"Allow clients to brouse anytime, without restrictions, at the design centre prior to picking options and upgrades."
TAM0412118,We like the master bedroom is not above the garage.
TAM0614114,nothing.
TAM09171007,It would be really nice to have the option to digitally be able to try different exterior colors with the different house elevations rather than driving around the neighbourhood and viewing the colors on other homes.
TAM1212105,"Design Centre was really good.
Sales Centre - things were not clearly discussed.
Charged for items that thought were included and didn't find out until the design centre process.
Sales Centre model homes have upgrades which you thought were standard features and didn't realize they were upgrades."
TAM06161018,Nothing. I just like everything.
TAM0613115,I Wouldn't change anything.
TAM01191009,"Maybe it was just bad luck but I did not enjoy the first part of my Design process. I was willing to get upgrades but was not sure what was possible (ex: bathroom sinks, types of tubs...). I did not see a book with pictures of available things other than fireplaces, doors. Also, seems like the options had double and almost changed completely in the design center from the time I had started to the end of the process.  I had chosen many things just to learn weeks after that they were going to be discontinued."
TAM1011121,Have more models available. We changed our mind from the only model home available after seeing  another being purchased by an acquiantance
TAM1014124,Seeing all the standard features versus options at the sales centre
TAM1110113,nothing yet
TAM10191005,"No need for that many appointments. It is difficult for me to take time off work. Also, the staff in the design center could be more knowledgeable. Sometimes I couldn't get straight answers to my upgrade questions."
TAM0311112,mantain what you have valerie is a great person and works very hard and takes her job very seriously...i hope to work with your team again and special thanks to mandy mason at the design center great to work with her attention to details and a wonderful personality...thanks robert palarchio...
TAM08171023,NA
TAM0612131,I don't know yet
TAM1010132,"we felt like we were making huge decisions without a lot of time to do so. I would recommend having the design centre process start much earlier, allowing people more time to go in and see what their options are."
TAM0613118,"It would be more efficient if the design centre representative could accompany with us when we chose our color and patterns. That was a very time-consuming process as we know nothing about those products, like standard/upgrade, price,etc. For every piece we chose, for example the color and pattern of the kitchen carbinet, I have to go downstairs to ask somebody if this combination is standard or not,as the design centre located in 2nd floor and people works in 1st floor.and because the matrix is so complex it hard to understand without helper.Design center workers are good, they are knowledagable, however they were too busy to help us, I kept bugging them during chosen, we spent 5 hours to choose colors just for the kitchen area.

The current process let us choose first then go pricing them and if we think the price is too high then we have to go choose something else and then go pricing again. Budget is always a concern for us so this process is very time consuming."
TAM12191003,I have no suggestion at this time.
TAM09171006,"Looking at our house as it is coming along, we now realize there are certain upgrades that we just didn't think of adding to our new build (such as extra outdoor outlets/plugs, lights etc). This isn't so much a complaint as it is admission that we missed a few things and would probably have welcomed some additional suggestions on useful/popular upgrades that other home owners like to include. Had anything like this been suggested by the design centre or sales centre, we probably would have added a few things to our list. Would suggest a cheat-sheet of ""useful but often overlooked"" upgrades might be helpful during the process."
TAM06161004,"-A bit more time to review the attachments to the addendum to the purchase agreement, e.g., able to take home the documents before signing, would have helped prepare potential questions. Overall though, Noella and her team were super. Mandy Mason at the Design Centre was also very helpful. 

-There should have been more than one consultation given for the initial kitchen cabinet design. I had one visit to discuss the cabinet design and was expected to review a draft layout of the kitchen cabinets and give approval after the first visit. I was also expected to communicate any changes by phone or email. However, it is sometimes difficult to explain design changes on the phone or email. The Muskoka rep was sometimes unavailable; would respond after some time; would miss my emails with information requested. This has caused some delay on my color and design selection. I had to request a couple more meetings. I thought that the follow-up meetings should have been offered in the first place like what Tamarack Design does."
TAM08191051,Everything has been good so far.
TAM12191004,Nothing that I can think of.
TAM1118105,Excellent service by Mrs. Mendy Mason and big thank you to her.
TAM0912110,More time with design consultant.
TAM0916102,More flexibility to modify townhouse floorplan (merge two options together).
TAM1015120,"Nothing, it was pretty much what I expected."
TAM1211108,"Clearer answers on what some of the upgrades meant.  We had a heck of a time getting any information regarding the AC units avalable.  It was not until the date that we had to sign off on our upgrades that we got a clear response.  I contacted the design centre, and our sales rep, and they both told me to call the AC supplier directly, who were also unable to help.  I do not think this is the way it should be done."
TAM0912125,None
TAM0715111,"Nothing, design centre process was excellent! Both Ewa and Christine were excellent!!!"
TAM1213120,Perhaps having a list available of most commonly chosen co ours and upgrades for the community
TAM06191011,"The list they provide you about the upgrade is very long and over-whelming. The 1st meeting is very over-whelming, should be one more meeting. They should have the visualization on an IPad."
TAM0410117,"We were very impressed with the sales team. They offered excellent customer service and had always demonstrated professionalism towards their customers.  However, our experiences with the design centre process were atrocious. Our consultant was aggressive and unprofessional towards her clients. Her customer service skills need major development; she failed to follow-up on her customers' needs."
TAM08171017,"There was very little ability to carry out any minor changes to the home. There should be a way to increase on the option package. If the option desired is not on the list there should be a process to have it added for the current sale and then for future sales, it's only a way to make more money for you. 

Any items that are removed from the standard package such as mantels or bathroom accessories should get a credit. This is extremely disappointing that there is no credit given; we should not have to pay for something that Tamarack will actually be getting a credit for. When you spend the type of money on a home that we have and get treated with a ""take it or leave it"" attitude by the head office it makes us feel frustrated. 

On top of that, the quality of workmanship on the front of our townhomes is terrible. I have sent in pictures to Carla for action and we have been told by Charlie that the siding people will be back in to address the issues. But it is truly a sad state when I can drive by and see from my car 4 deficiencies that the trades shouldn't have allowed themselves. Add to that, a home 3 doors down has an overhang over the garage that is completely crooked. The front pad/pavers don't line up at all and are not graded the same left to right- this is when there is no other grading really done yet, so no match of grade required. Add to that, the colour of the pavers; all of the current Warmstone homes being finished and the row on Vivera are getting red pavers with no regard to the colour of the home. Red accents don't work with all colour schemes. From what we've seen on the outside we are concerned about the total quality of our home."
TAM1013127,"Everything was great other than when we went with the dark brown trim, nobody pointed out that other details of the outside of the house wouldn't match."
TAM1112102,Nothing it was a great experience.
TAM1112118,"The experience was great, we were a little overwhelmed at first and although the structural changes that had to be selected right away were explained to us, we missed things like the front door.  After the fact we were thinking of maybe changing the front door design but it was too late.  It would have been nice if different door options were shown to us prior to the very quick structural design deadline."
TAM06181015,I cannot think of anything.
TAM0714113,We have been very pleased with the whole process so far as well as all the wonderful and helpful staff we have encountered.
TAM0510131,"Mike should be the sales rep, he is the reason we purchased a Tamarack Home.  When we have visited the sales center Mike always greets us and asks us how we are doing.  He should be the face of that Office."
TAM0811115,"Clearly indicate when, based on an accelerated construction schedule for inventory homes, a pre-drywall inspection would occur and pre-drywall design changes had to be complete.

When we signed the purchase agreement, framing was complete or nearly complete but drywall had not been installed. We purchased the home with the understanding we'd receive a pre-drywall inspection to evaluate the home's construction and better consider pre-drywall modifications (e.g., additional lights/switches, gas/water lines, etc). We were advised that the decision-making process with regard to modifications/upgrades/design choices was accelerated because the home was already under construction--accelerated, not negated.

However, it wasn't until we had our first design centre meeting that we were informed that drywalling was complete, meaning we couldn't make any design changes without being charged for drywall repairs. Despite this oversight, we still had to repeatedly argue that Tamarack had failed to advise us that drywall installation was imminent, and that design changes and a pre-drywall inspection had to be complete. And based on this oversight on Tamarack's part, it was insulting that we were to be charged drywall repairs for the design choices we desired. Furthermore, the fact that it was then impossible to perform a pre-drywall inspection made matters worse.

This situation was not handled well at all. Our design choices were consequently rushed and compromised, and the value from inspecting the infrastructure of one's home before drywall is installed was lost forever without any compensation or consideration."
TAM0317103,Would get some additional upgrades
TAM0916100,nothing
TAM12171016,"WOULD BE BETTER TO EXPLAIN EVERY SINGLE DETAIL WHAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER PURCHASE AND ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND THE NEXT EVENTS AND SO ON.
THANKS"
TAM12171015,Longer time to select my selection at design centre
TAM12181010,More drop in availability to consult with a designer for the design centre process outside of the set appointments.
TAM1015107,"- Absolutley Nothing, the experience has been exceptional"
TAM1013113,"the kitchen has to be big size for most the new home 
every backyard homes  has to be a wall to make it private backyard for the family to set make a BBQ. it has to be with the price of the home."
TAM1113114,perhaps larger samples of paint colours or current choice examples in model homes
TAM0713117,"We bought a quick-inventory home and we wanted the quickest possible closing, immediately after finalizing the deal we were prepared and ready to pick our design centre selections. Meanwhile, two weeks were wasted before appointments were made. Therefore, the term quick-inventory is rather disappointing."
TAM1113112,"1) Our home is a reverse model. In our design and selection process we were always provided with floor plans that were for the regular model. We did receive a reverse plan in the sales agreement, but these plans were not used in the review selection and marking process (frame check was also done with non-reverse plan). Process Change- Use reverse floor plans with mark-up additions where required.

2) From the electrical provider we were sent to, in the selection of the pot lights, cable, Bell, additional outlets, positioning for these items on the diagrams we received was not accurate. Mandy, from the Design Center, recreated all of the electrical-lighting floor plans on her system (on reverse plan) and did a perfect job on the positioning of our additions, with very clear notes on alterations. Process Change- Have Design Center create electrical diagrams.

3) In the acceptance sign-off to the provider of our quartz countertops, the sales agent was extremely busy during our 1 pm scheduled appointment with about 3 or 4 other customers. We had about 5 minutes in our scheduled appointment to ask any questions regarding our two counter tops (of which we had major concerns with gouges on one slab). The following day I revisited the company. The same agent was very pleasant and took all the time I needed to answer all of my questions. Process Change- Receive dedicated time in our scheduled appointment.

We are very happy to be owners of our new Tamarack home."
TAM06191001,"Please provide significantly more clarity on the timeline of events, and key check in dates."
TAM02171010,"This has been a wonderful experience and has surpassed the overall quality of service and sales experience that we had received compared to other builders that we had dealt with in the past. I will recommend Tamarack to my family and friends. The only minor change that I would have made for myself would have been to request to see a visual of the new tub style that was going to be installed in the en-suite of our master bedroom. I was informed that our home would not have the large roman soaker tub which was displayed in the model homes but instead would have a different, more modern tub style. Looking back, I should have asked to see a visual of this tub to calm my curiosity."
TAM11191000,Orientation session. Provide catalogue for review prior to meeting with designer. Ensure all pricing is reviewed.
TAM0915108,"Clearly indicate any changes since purchasing to standard design options so that the client has the opportunity to upgrade (ex. the standard fireplaces were changed without being told) Luckily we were able to change them after noticing the difference at the model homes.

An online a la carte option sheet would be a great idea! When upgrading numerous items it becomes difficult to keep track of all the changes. A system with pictures and descriptions that you could input would allow the client to be better prepared for design appointments and save a lot of time on both ends. Just a thought!

Overall - Very Satisfied Customer so far! We can't wait to move in!"
TAM0317111,"We were very happy with our experience. Some comments but again, not complaints just feedback. Later hours at design Centre. The Maskoka kitchen digital renderings were very helpful. I wish we could see digital renderings from Tamarack with all of our colour choices and house options. Would help us see what we are selecting and how it looks."
TAM08191047,"1. A more welcoming sales center attitude. Sales reps and managers should be rotated across community sales centers to diversify sales styles. This is the first point of contact, and could be a deal maker or deal breaker.
2. Increased clarity on structural/sales center design decisions vs. design center decisions. We were not made aware of front door selection during sales stage.
3. Design center selection sheet was quite unreadable. Bundles should be made clearer, and pictures would be significantly helpful in budgeting upgrades."
TAM09171003,"The $10K sales incentive is deceiving ... It's in fact a $8,849.56 rebate + HST ... not a $10K deduction on your bottom line before taxes.
So it's basically ""false advertisement"". You should change that. I already pointed this out to our Sales person when we signed
the purchase agreement. I know it's written in the purchase agreement but the way Tamarack advertise its $10K incentive is wrong."
TAM1213100,Nothing it was overal a good experience
TAM0717120,We would have liked to have had the home layout online with the ability to have design selections online to allow us to visualize options and selections
TAM0313126,"The design center kept adding my boyfriend name on every sheet (the color selection, the kitchen upgrades sheet,etc)regardless of my wishes to remove his name since I am the house purchaser.I believe his name was added because both our names were on the information card and was entered to the system this way. The sales office removed his name at the time of buying the house but not the design center.It was not until i refused to sign the amendment to the agreement of purchase that the design center removed his name.  I have asked the design center to reprint the rest of the design center sheets with only my name on it but i was told this can not be done since i have already signed and the only sheet that matters is the amendment.I was  told that i could sign the amendment first then get his name removed after. If I have not refused to sign the amendment with his name on it, I believe that his name would show on it as well and it would be too late to remove it like the other design center sheets."
TAM0813106,"That the design centre would be more accommodating.  We did not get to choose much to make the house our own.  For example, we couldn't have a back splash in our kitchen.  We requested a couple light in the house and a light for the fridge.  We got the one for the fridge but not the other lights.  In general, she was not very accommodating."
TAM07191038,N/A
TAM05191007,"More time at the design center, 2 days is not enough."
TAM1109123,"Sales center is always efficient and prompt response.

For design center, the first orientation good. But it is not necessary be done by the designer. Julie ( the receptionist ) did this job very good. In that case, the designer will have more time for 2nd and 3rd appointment."
TAM0510118,"Sales center was excellent. Louise Weegar was extremely helpful and in all our experience (homes, rental properties & condos we have purchased) have never had someone that has helped us every step of the way. We would purchase another Tamarack home if she would be our sales person!

Design center was very complex, especially compared to Tartan which does everything in one place. The 1st appt for intro was useless and a waste of time. Verydisappointing to get there and find out that you then have to book 3 other appts for kitchen, alarm system, wiring etc. Standard selections are very nice, kitchen cabinetry is too complex and should be simplified. Kim Knuth was our representative and she was excellent"
TAM0614207,"I think everything is good, nothing to change!"
TAM07191014,to make  a tour at my new home before the closing date.
TAM09191022,I hope I can design myself through website like Tartan .
TAM1112106,make appointments later on in the day. we both work 9-5 so had to book off work for our design centre appointments.
TAM1013104,"NothiNg. Very good experience, great builder :)"
TAM0913103,nothig the experience so far has been nothing but the best thank you
TAM0315104,Deign Center should be able to define individual price and other options of our choice.  I understand that because of insurance we are not allowed to enter the new structure.  Some customers are more knowledeable than others and should be allowed supervised access during the build.
TAM1215102,A visual aid such as a program to see your design choices automatically layed out in your home.  Will take the guessing out of whether it will look good or not as it will justify the small sample sizes
TAM1016109,"The design centre would be better laid out with respect to upgrades being better defined and more visible.  Also, the tile should be easier to browse through."
TAM04182002,"Sales and design centre are good, nothing needs to be changed"
TAM0613106,"There was no input in some changes I was looking to have made and was willing to pay for.
ie. second laundry room hookup in basement. With Mattamy options like this were available if paid for. 
Very rigid structure with no flex at Tamarack."
TAM0516104,"Nothing that I can think of; so far, the purchase has been as good or better than anticipated."
TAM0411116,Everybody was professional and helpful.  Noella is very friendly and its always a pleasure to visit her and her team.  Kim was very knowledgeable and had great ideas.  The team at the design centre was always very welcoming and always made time to answer questions.  We dealt with 3 dif girls at the design centre and they were all very good.  It was a pleasure going to every meeting.  I can see you have put some thought and time in the entire buying experience for your customers and it was a great experience.  I have recommended Tamarack to all my friends.
TAM0816114,"Just to have much more communication for first time homebuyers to fully understand the process and not feel so left in the dark as well as to have the opportunity to visit the home while the design choices are being installed to ensure it is the correct colors, counters and all choices etc..."
TAM1016100,We would have appreciated an extra staff member present in the design center for clients that are simply browsing with questions about upgrades and standard features. We went 3 times following our home purchase but were unable to ask questions as the design agents were with other clients and there was no one else available. Mandy Mason was assigned to us and is amazing! Knowledgeable and professional!
TAM09181014,"During the sales stage (1st meeting)...there should be NOTHING to be discussed with regards to upgrades. Upgrades SHOULD be discussed during the design stage. During the design stage, they asked everything that we wanted, inside and out,  but she doesn't know what is standard or not.  To be more specific, she showed us a shower style in the showroom that we are supposed to get, asked us the type and size of tiles, etc.. but that was the opposite of the shower that we are getting. We were carried over for a long period of time... time went on and then they told us we are not getting what we wanted until it was too late to make such changes.  ***Is it true that before papers were signed during the sales process, materials for the house were already bought and customers can no longer make any changes?***  In closing, we are not happy with our future house because we did not get what we wanted."
TAM01171005,Having to deal with the brick for the appliances
TAM1216104,No changes.
TAM0511130,I believe more time should be allocated during the design centre process.  I felt that there wasn't enough time with the design centre rep for us to ask all our questions and go through each step and/or room.
TAM1014103,It is done in a professional manner.
TAM1215100,Knowing prices of upgrades prior to purchase
TAM1111106,date of moving in
TAM0513113,I would recommend more transparency in the initial buying phase regarding what comes standard and upgrades.  Providing the home buyer with a list of what constitutes an upgrade and the price associated it with it.  This would help give the home buyer a better of idea of what the final price will be on the home they are purchasing.
TAM0816112,"Customer service reception at design centre needs a lot of improvement.
Design centre should provide more options on Saturday for appointments for those 
Who have no time during weekdays."
TAM0314112,"We would have appreciated being told in advance that our design centre bonus would have HST applied to it. Furthermore, the final total cost of our home was misquoted to us three times before we received an accurate price. For 80% of our schedules meetings with sales and design centre staff, the staff were either absent or extremely late (greater than 30 minutes). The design centre staff made several mistakes we had to correct multiple times regarding upgrades we selected. During our frame inspection walkthrough, we found empty beer cans in one of the closets in our new home and the sales rep accompanying us did not apologize and simply told us that this was an ongoing problem with their builders."
TAM1012109,Better upgrade prices.  No double charging ie pay for standard and pay again for upgrade to hardwood floors.  Upgrades are extremely pricy.  No credit towards standard items when upgrades are made.
TAM0412113,nothing
TAM0913104,No comment.
TAM0510139,"The part which I would change was Muskoka cabinet appointment/design portion.
After our Muskoka appointment we were not given any pricing information until the very last design center appointment when we were to sign off on the final agreement. 
This left some of our final decision making extremely hurried since we did not have access to this costing information. We tried to take it in stride  but I can see the typical buyer react much more negatively."
TAM0711102,"Some of the sales center staff were unfriendly, condescending and we dreaded having to go there.  The design center process was ok; we were very disappointed with the offerings.  We chose Tamarack because we believed the standards were a class above other builders.  This is not the case.  At least 20K in upgrades on top of the purchase price is required to make the house somewhat modern.  The kitchen options were so poor that had we visited the design center prior to the purchase, we would not own a Tamarack home.  Some of the design center staff only pushed upgraded items, and didn't offer alternatives from the standard selections."
TAM08171022,"All is well. I would like to suggest you one thing that they were not able to explain about the upgrades like extra window in the basement, brick in the front in triangle area . Optional upgrade list is very important for customer. Overall experience with tamarack is amazing ??????????"
TAM0911115,I would have liked to have seen greater flexibility with the design and better quality for the standard options (kitchen design was particularly poor).
TAM08191030,no change necessary
TAM0614202,"Sales was fantastic!
She could not answer Design question it was already chosen I scored it a 7:During the design selections experience, the Design Consultant:"
TAM06171015,"More time should be provided to single home buyers at design centre, all items like tiles should be properly laid out. There should be standard and upgrades separately visible for comparison. Muskoka kitchen representative is always in rush and not very friendly with customers and do not listen to their concerns. Always tries to rush with the selection process. She is pro in her field but home buyers are not. It would be nice if the rates are displayed with the upgrades to make quick decisions."
TAM0813113,Tera and Carolyn and every vendor and supplier from tackaberry to Muskoka to grants were just awesome.  Building the house while we lived in San Francisco was made incredibly easy and we felt like we had an advocate working for us.   Terrific staff and terrific builder.   We can't wait to move our family into the neighborhood.
TAM0711109,More time and assistance in becoming familiar with the process and difference between standard and upgrades.
TAM10181037,Need more transperancy on custom upgrade pricing. Granite extension for kitchen island seems to be overpriced. Sales representative should highlight differences between model home and actual home clearly so that customers can make informed decisions.
TAM11191026,"I hope the design center can provide a picture or a 3-D vision result after we picked up all of our designs. 
This will give us better idea on where we want to change, or if the colour matches."
TAM0615106,"Be more receptive to client needs. Prices are totally exaggerated. Builder shows absolutely no flexibility for very simple things. Builder is not at all responsible for the environment. 

I don't know a single person who is happy after going through the design centre. Sometimes you simply want them not to install something because they changed the specs and they will not even make an effort to please the client and listen to their needs. 
I hope one day they will realize that the market is not always rosy and this is when they will hurt. Overall. It was a very unpleasant and frustrating experience dealing with the builder. The design centre staff was very caring and tried their best to accommodate us and listen to our needs but it felt like the decidion was made based on the mood if the guy at head office."
TAM04182006,The 2 biggest issues we had during our home buying experience were during the design selection phase (the young lady working in this department seemed very unprepared and made numerous mistakes during this process).  We had to constantly check and double check the details which was very frustrating.  The second issue we had was the delay in closing - our home was delayed a few times which has caused additional stress.
TAM0710113,Communication between the sale centre and the progress of the home being build.  We requested to know if our home was going to be delayed or not.  Sale centre was unable to provide us with that information.  Had to contact Customer Service Rep. during the week.  The information should be accessible through the sale centre.
TAM02182011,"Very good experience thanks to Noella, Kim and Ewa."
TAM10191034,Their pricing method was little vague and complicated when it came to premium upgrades vs to the standard. They used a little lure tactics to get the upgrades it could be more clear.
TAM0614100,"That everyone would be fully bilingual, joyful, friendly."
TAM01181008,"I was not happy with increasing the house price and decreasing the design centre bounce at the same time. If I had the chance to make any change, I will stick to the price of the house and/or the bounce for the design centre."
TAM0816105,I am ok with the sales and the process.  I was a bit surprise of fast the upgrades can add up.  I enjoyed the overall process and I will be better prepared for my next purchase.
TAM0915124,"At this point of process I would not change anything, been happy so far"
TAM0411125,Wish I had more money to spend!  Everyone I have dealt with so far have been very helpful.
TAM0312115,Nothing at all!!  Both Val and Mandy were amazing!!  Had a great experience!!!
TAM05191006,"Similar to furnaces and ACs, include water heater tanks into the price of the house rather than pushing customers to sign rental agreements. If customers decide to buy the water heaters, have proper documentation at hand including price, warranty, specs, model etc.. What is currently happening is very shady in contrary to the reputable name of Tamarack !"
TAM0513117,nothing
TAM10191015,Extra available appointments with the design center
TAM01201006,"No, nothing."
TAM0613108,to integrate the design in virtuel way
TAM09191039,"The lack of a website to facilitate design choices and the lack of visual information about upgrades (what does toilet model XZC74bRF5 look like? No clue.)

In the same vein, a 3D ""walk through"" (virtual reality headset!) would be dramatically awesome.

Also problematic was the lack of information about models or functionalities offered by ""furnace upgrade"" or ""refrigerant unit"" or ""humidifier add-on""."
TAM01201007,Nothing
TAM1216105,"1. The design  center process needs to be more structured, so the customer can be more aware of timing for all designs to be chosen and more time to select choices/change choices at the last appointment and review the documents to ensure they are accurate and complete.
2. There should be a one-page docuemnt with the full cycle of the process from signing the CAPS to the movein date with approximate timelines."
TAM12181009,Not understanding how a gas line can be offered for a dryer and not a stove when the gas line runs 3feet from the stove location to the hot water tank upstairs in the gallery townhomes.
TAM1014131,"There was a lack of communication during the walk through, the builder did not note any deficiencies - if something is discontinued be up to date with material (decor)."
TAM11191005,"I would like to have more time to make my choices, design centre should be more organized and have clearer labeling so clients are able to compare quality and prices with less confusion . It would also be nice to have staff to help you better in the show room before meeting with the designers. There should always be someone at reception in showroom ."
TAM10171034,Everything went well. There is not much to change.
TAM04171025,Both processes have been exceptional!  The communication and professionalism we have encountered by all your staff has been outstanding and they have all be very courteous and friendly!  This journey has been a most enjoyable one!  Can't think of anything we would change at this point!
TAM0516109,it would be nice to have the structural and design changes to happen together as they often go hand in hand.  It was a pain having to go back to the model homes to make a structural change based on the design finishes we wanted
TAM0909109,"During the design centre appointment, we were rushed to make our decisions. It took a month to schedule an appointment (they were completely booked). When I called to reschedule the first appointment due to family emergency, I was told that if I did reschedule my closing date could no longer be guaranteed because the Tamarack head office hadn't notified the design centre of our closing date until very late in the process. At the design centre, there were no prices on many of the tiles. We had to wait for our selection to be priced. This took quite a long time, and, in the end, we settled for an upgraded kitchen backsplash that we didn't really like for over $1300, simply because it took too long to get the quotations and we had run out of time. We were pressured to sign the agreement the night of our third appointment (before the 45 day period had expired), but we insisted on taking it home for our review. We were again told that, if we took longer than a day to return the agreement, our closing date would be in jeopardy, even though we were only on day 41. When we read it over, we found a mistake in the selection of the kitchen backsplash. 
Our sales representative has been very friendly and has answered many of our questions. However, we have been waiting on a response from issues highlighted by our building inspector for over two weeks."
TAM0914105,We wouldn't change a thing. The whole process was very smooth.
TAM0615121,"Nothing, everything is fine."
TAM1211112,"I wish there were model homes of all the types of home Tamarack is selling. But because of their reputation I bought one without seing a model of our choice.



Good job Tamarack!"
TAM0511103,"To be honest the process was very efficient and well organized.

The only thing I would recommend is to be clear since the start of the process about what your home does include and what you have to pay for (outside of the upgrades).

Being a first time home owner, there were many things I didn't know, and I only found out along the way that weren't included as part of the sale price of the house (i.e. the AC unit).  I know that if you ask, the girls at Woodhaven will provide the proper answer, but maybe you can create a check list of what the sales price of the house includes.  A basic standard listing showing all items included as part of the base sale price.  I would do this before the sale of the house.

I know the idea is to sell a home, but all upgrades should be made clear at the start, for example, if you state that hardwood floors are standard throughout the first floor, then make it clear that that means the lightest stain of wood.  Any other stain will cost more.

It might just be that I was a 'rookie' when buying my home, but it definitely does help to have all info. upfront to make a decision.

Don't get me wrong, I love what we have done with our home and how things are coming along, and I am currently recommending Tamarack homes to everyone I know!!

But I just wanted to let you know what upfront info. I would have liked to see.

Thanks,
Jason"
TAM06161009,More time to be provided at the Design Center. My time was very limited and provided only two weeks to complete the whole process.
TAM08181033,"The sales center provided inaccurate information on three separate occasions - with respect to the island overhang in our kitchen, the vapour barrier for the garage, the location of the electrical box in the basement, and the type of lighting (e.g. we were not informed that the pot lights were not LED bulbs). As such, this significantly effected our experience with Tamarack at the design center and caused additional (and unnecessary) stress throughout the process. Moreover, because of these inaccuracies, I would not recommend Tamarack to my friends and family going forward."
TAM0812117,"""Getting quotes from design specialist, which seemed independent / disconnected from Sales Centre. Had many, many quotes (for design upgrades) over days, which could and should have been consolidated and expedited. Have better communication between Design Centre and Sales Centre. 

Pricing for design upgrades are ridiculously over-priced compared to retail prices. Labour is often the same, so should just be a cost difference / delta between a standard item and an upgrade."""
TAM02171007,I think if the design center can show the 3-D house based on my selections that would be great.
TAM0911125,N/A
TAM05191038,"Just some constructive feedback:  if the previous ""standards"" and now ""upgrades"" that the price be reflective as soon as possible. There were a couple of items we liked from the show home and were told were standard but by the time we did our selections (4 months later) some of the standards became upgrades. Jacqui and Caroline were wonderful in working with us on this and we don't have complaints, just wanted to make a note while we can."
TAM10171032,"flexability with design change.  Wanted basement finished, but was limited to one design option, which did not suit my needs."
TAM1015123,Design centre only told us the pricing the day of our appointment
TAM0610108,The Design Centre should have more display of pre-set combinations.
TAM1118110,"Design center:   catalogue has too many pages and not user friendly user.   When making upgrades the catalogue should advise what other items require  upgrading to accommodate the new changes.  For example:  when upgrading the granite sink no mention that the faucets require upgrading as well,  we find out after the fact.  This should be outlined in the catalogue instead of having to purchase items afterwards to fit the upgrade.         Décor Consultant was excellent this has nothing to do with her.  Its more about the catalogue information and lack of information the homeowner receives.  

We found the sales office did not know accurate specification of home features.  For example,  we specifically inquired about the garage insulated.  The office advised that insulation is included but to surprised it wasn't.  Apparently this was an upgrade an not a standard. 
 
Looking forward to the PDI survey,  would like to receive the survey sooner then later."
TAM10191017,Add French speaking staff on both sections.
TAM0912101,"The design centre was not very helpful, very unorganized and rude. I had to make multiple trips to the design centre for a number of mistakes that they had made after I had already signed the papers. The design centre should make sure that when the customer chooses an item out of the catalogues given that they are up to date on the discontinued items within the catalogue."
TAM0715108,"Everything went very smoothly and everyone was very supportive. A question i do have however surrounds the bonus for That we provided upon initial purchase. The Person who referred us to Tamarack was to receive a financial bonus as were we, the purchaser. I have not heard anything else about this. I believe it was 500$ or 1000$. Could we be informed on this status?"
TAM07181036,"Nothing really, it went smoothly."
TAM11171009,"I would improve the Sales Center experience.  I felt, as the customer, (I could be wrong, but this is how I felt) that we were really valued when we were deciding on which Builder to go for, but once we made up our mind on Tamarack and put the deposit, we did not feel greatly valued after that. Had a couple of bad instances as well. Though they were both corrected later on, involving higher management of Tamarack. 

The design center experience was really awesome though! Our design consultant really went out of her way to give us quality service.  She never refused to accommodate our needs and expectations, and worked with us in our limited budget.  Twice she had to stay back late (after hours) to complete our appointments. She did everything she could to make us feel valued!  She really deserves a raise! :)"
TAM1014126,"We had an issue with the lot allocation and it was given away while we still had a signed contract and Tamarack still had out deposit cheque. It the end it wa sorted out but it definately tainted our experience. Also, we were not told that the premium lot is considered an upgrade and that taxes were not included in the price. That brought up our price by approximately $10K which is a substantial amount that we had not budgeted for taxes."
TAM09181018,Prices of upgrades readily available instead of checking every time. Maybe online.
TAM06161026,"Considering that closing date is not there yet, and that I got the house after it was finished, I guess there is not much to say.
The only concern is about not leaving any space in the conversation for external inspectors to perform the pre-closing inspection."
TAM0615107,Found the plumbing contractor was abusive in upgrades
TAM0717122,"Mr. Taggart, there is nothing I would change as far  as your frontline people are concerned. They are everything  a company
like yours would want. 
 The only thing that really pissed me off was as I said before I purchased an inventory home I had to pay a $1,000 to you
because the fireplace was in the basement, A decision that was made during construction by somebody else at my expense.
Now I don't know if anybody else has mentioned this in their comments but I feel if you have no say in where the fireplace goes
you shouldn't have to pay $1,000. If you don't agree with me than enjoy my money and have beer on me."
TAM0412117,"everything is going well so far. Option selection could have been better by offering up more choices based on my needs. But, rep did not ask enough questions."
TAM06191019,I was not allowed to add pot lights in the basement. Basement bulk head is too low and when we noticed that we requested that regular lights will be a safety hazard as they were too low. But we were told that it’s not allowed to make changes. Even though site supervisor told us that still basement is under construction that it was possible to change the lights. Wiring was still being done.
TAM09181037,"Allow certain changes at the design centre, such as choosing hardwood stairs and frosted windows."
TAM03182028,If you have some models that s great for us to look for the upgrade
TAM03182007,"The Walk Through: By the time you do the frame check walk through, everything is already done so when I asked for changes they said that they could not make them."
TAM04182000,Have more trained staff on site with more availability for purchaser in design center.
TAM0414108,"Nothing, everything was great."
TAM08191037,We felt rushed at the Design Center and did not have  full attention required to help make our decision.   During our visits their was other customers  in the center and it was very  hard to obtain help when needed.   We would suggest during the last meeting (3rd meeting) the homeowner has the opportunity to sit with the design consultant to go through final decision and have the opportunity to ask questions and help with changes.   We would also suggest extending extra help to first time buyer who are not familiar with the buying/selection process and along the way.
TAM1011143,Would like to see more model homes on site.
TAM1013130,Nothing at this point
TAM0611128,"We are very pleased at the level of professionalism, the quality of work, the attentiveness to detail and the responsiveness to our questions and concerns.

Tamarack has proven its value many times over in each interaction we have had and we will not hesitate to enthusiastically recommend Tamarack as a premier home builder.

Many Thanks,

Lori-Ann McGrath & Curtis Harnanan 
(Hartland model, Jackson Trails)"
TAM0313107,"I wouldn't change anything your staff and representatives were a pleasure to work with. I had alot of fun choose the home then wha goes in the home, and am very excited to move in!!!
Thank you"
TAM0810110,"More fleible hours at the design centre.  (open Sundays for a few hrs)
More flexible dates to book your appointements w/ your rep at the design centre. (When Chantal called she gave me one (1) possible date to meet w/ Kim to do our final pics).  There was zero flexibility until I called head office.

I wouldn't change anything about the sales office."
TAM1015119,I wouldn't change anything. It was perfect as is. Very satisfied!
TAM1112101,So far so good. We would not change a thing. Our home was an inventory home in Orleans on Grammond Circle and all the selections were already made prior to us buying it but we were given the opportunity to go view what was selected. Our home on lot 111 address 332 Grammond circle should be ready November 15th and we hope to be able to have a tour perhaps 3 weeks before closing to see what has been done. Thank you. Anick Lavoie Gauthier and Len Gauthier.
TAM0713106,No changes
TAM08191000,"More communication needs to take place between the sales office and design centre and construction. I felt that my colour selection and upgrades were rushed through and i didn’t have adequate time to make my final decision. As well, if I had questions about the physical construction of the house I didn’t really know who to ask."
TAM12171006,"We currently live north of Montreal (about 2hrs away). I would have appreciated a few photos during construction sent to me, both for a time line of progress and to see how the house was being built. Another small issue during construction was that in spite of having signed off quickly for design changes (kitchen sink//dishwasher moved from island to counter under window) the roughed in plumbing & water were under the island location. It is a waste of time & floor repair to move it to the correct location. Please consider sending the purchasers a few photos during the construction"
TAM0913124,"We should not have to pay to remove items that we have not installed yet.  Example, delete a microwave shelf in order to have an OTR microwave, cabinets haven't been built yet.  Also paying for upgrades that replace what has already been paid for.  Example, the standard railing is included in the price of the house, upgrading the railing costs extra, so we basically pay for two railings, one of which will never be installed.  Prices should be calculated accordingly.

The sales staff (Deb and Michael) were absolutely phenomenal for over a year of us searching for our home.  They made the experience fun, wonderful, and not stressful at all.  I would give them raises."
TAM0411107,That not everything is an upgrade. Gets very expensive if you have upgrade the smallest things where the company could have done it
TAM0511112,Seating in the sales office for more than two people.  Although we were comfortable there wasn't room for any others of our family who were involved.  Perhaps the sales desk could be moved back another foot or two to allow customers some more room.  A minor point but you did ask.  Thank you for asking our opinion.
TAM0413115,Nothing
TAM0713101,"If you want answer, better to have a single window model and to continue dealing with sales rep throughout the process.  Debbie Champagne and headquarters employees do not return call and are disconnected from owners' files"
TAM1016112,"Disappointed that we were asked to push the firm closing date back, as this has added the stress that the house may not be ready on time and we have sold our present house."
TAM0411104,"Sales Centre - Things discussed about our new house were not always properly noted in the paperwork or were forgotten about completely.  Sometimes, we have been told one thing only to have the information change the next time we are at the sales centre discussing our house.  It's can be very confusing.  It makes you feel like you need to write everything down or tape the conversations to make sure you're getting the information correct.  Definitely not enough time to sit and go over the blueprints and not enough information on what to look for on the blueprints.  It's easy to miss things if you don't know what you're looking for or at.
Design Centre:  Choices of standard tiles for the kitchen backsplash are extremely poor.  Notices need to be posted when pricing has changed for upgraded items.  We priced out an upgraded tile that was listed in the binder at a certain price and then found out the next week that the binder price was incorrect and the item had gone up considerably to the point that we could no longer afford it.  It's very disappointing and discouraging.  My wife was near tears a few times when we couldn't find a kitchen backsplash that we liked or that we could afford
However, everyone at the design centre is very nice and very helpful"
TAM0114106,Possibly consider extending evening hours beyond 7:00 p.m. or be open every day of the week until 7:00 p.m.
TAM0612114,"When you chose an upgrade should be reimbursed for the standard option..........greedy not to do otherwise.....Muskoka does it.

Unhappy about the additional cost added to granite purchases.  Should be able to get pricing on different models at Emerald.

Cupboards should be available at Grant's tile so you don't have to carry them back and forth."
TAM07181030,The sales representative did a great job!
TAM0811125,"We loved Deb and Mike, they treated us very well.  I think Tamarack should have a few more model homes for viewing."
TAM0813116,"We did feel at times that, because we were trying to keep our budget low, we didn't always receive as much attention from some of the reps/employees as we would have if we were looking to spend more.  There were a few instances throughout the process where we were a bit blindsided by things that almost made us walk away from working with Tamarack all together but had already invested so much time and it wouldn't be feasible to choose another builder with what little time we had left (we are from out of town and were in town to purchase a house).  We understand that many builders have similar upgrade costs and some of Tamarack's were reasonable (such as upgrading from Oak to Maple flooring) but many were very unreasonable (for example, staggering tile, adding pot lights, etc..)  We are aware that these things take more time, and in some instances more material, but it does not require much, if any, more time/work on the company's end so any overhead costs shouldn't apply, in our opinion. We walked away with the upgrades that were most important to us, but would have been happy to do more and pay more for the house if we felt the costs were appropriate.  Although we know we will be happy with the house, we did feel that the costs of some items were dissuading us from upgrading.
In addition, we found it very difficult to choose our options from such small templates (the 2x4 inch paint swatch, in particular).  This made our process quite lengthy.  If there were larger samples of products, it would be easier and if there was someway to have computer software to be able to see a rough idea of how cupboards/flooring/paint look together - and lighting locations - it would have made the job way easier."
TAM0911100,Perhaps a better process to buy the house instead of standing in line before the houses went for sale.
TAM0712109,"Given we did not have many option because of the City of Ottawa had pre-approved our plans, I would have liked to have made some minor design changes that we were not allowed to do. While I understand why, its still disappointing."
TAM0416102,Structural meeting
TAM1109108,Would have a determined closing date at the time of signing not TBA
TAM10191040,Give more time frame
TAM08191003,More flexible hour and fewer options.
TAM0615105,"A bit more clarity on date ranges - we were uncertain when the actual design process would start, so nervously followed up a couple times."
TAM0511113,more otions and clearer price ranges
TAM08172008,Not much to change
TAM08191042,The design centre should be more open to the need of clients. Software that can help to visualize choices will be helpful at the design centre.
TAM0312113,It would have been better to have more notice prior to the inspection
TAM0715115,"Initial timing presented by Design Centre was not sufficient or consistent with written timelines.  However, this was addressed once feedback was provided through sales and customer service reps"
TAM1118111,"Design Center:  would recommend shorter meeting times with extra appointments.  To have move appointments available on Saturdays.  Some people are not available to leave during the week-days due to work.  It would be great to open Décor Center on the weekend. 

Painting:  Lots for spots, cracks and strikes on wall.  Metal  piece exposed on the ceiling and needs be replaced.  Rush job on the painting all around the house.

Sales Rep:  Needs to be more knowledgeable as we had questions that took along time to receive answers (month or so) and most times with no answer or would tell us to discuss with the décor center who would then direct us to the construction office. 


Frame Walk-through:   We didn't realize what the purpose of the appointment was until we had left as we did not received an explanation. 

We are previous owners of Tamarack homes and purchased through your company again given the great home and service experience received.  Our first home experience was  a lot better from start to finish.  We had repairs completed right away.     Not happy that trades services not working  over the winter as we have issues that we would like to fix.   Example hole in garage that is leaking cold air  into the house that would be nice to have it fixed now.   We have covered the hole with tape etc.  Our heating bill has been affected due to cold entering into our home."
TAM1015129,Too many upgrades that should be standard. Incentive of upgrade should be increased or higher. We would have liked to have a choice of hardwood floors instead of carpets without additional fee on 2nd floor.
TAM0715116,"It would have been nice if the builder would have been more flexible. We understand we bought the home at drywall but all things considered removing things like the prefab so we didn't have to do it after we close would have saved us time later. We really had the master bathroom high up on our priority list but with the added costs of removal of the prefab we were unable to do things before we close. With a baby, it just makes the process that much more difficult after the fact."
TAM1010128,"There was a lot of miscommunication between the kitchen design and design center; a few times they told us it was the other who would take care of certain design aspects.  As well, we emailed the designed numerous changes and they hadn't been changed in the file prior to our visit.  All of the old choices were displayed upon entering the design center instead of the newly emailee choices which easily added 30-40 minutes on the design process.  However, the consultant was extremely patient with us and very knowledgable.  More consultants are definitely needed for this bulk of volume."
TAM0809101,I would have the Pres & Vice Pres & other Top guys to get off their seats and come out & meet us the Buyers.
TAM01181012,Design center shall be more capable of offering alternatives to meet the customer satisfactory
TAM12191018,The lady with the design she needs to be nicer and not rush when figuring things out.  I felt I was taking too much time and she was bored with my time with her.  You might want to switch people around so they are not bored and maybe switch your standard selections up a bit.  Give the designer more ideas to think about and help with the design.
TAM07191044,"The design centre I would provide a coat hanger for people.  Maybe coffee or water dispenser.  The rep had her own coffee.  We never had a chance to look at a model home.  The design centre should have had more samples to choose from.  Maybe 3d model software would help in the design centre to see what the choices would look like rather then jus the samples.  It would make the process quicker.  In Kingston, we had to stop at a completely different to get the safety gear.  Also the safety boots were too big.  They didn't have a size for women and they could have been a tripping hazard.  I managed but they should have something for women.
Communication with the design centre, some communication problems.  Some of the samples weren't there and we had to go to Westborough.  There was a miscommunication with the grout colour.  Also discrepancy with shower tile.  We caught a mistake with colour.  A good idea for the design to emphasize to the customer to make notes to compare with the design centre sheets so that the home owner can double check things like we did and catch mistakes before they happen and get put in the house."
TAM08171006,"Would like to have had a heads up when it was design time instead of being told ""here are the 3 dates"". The fact the consultations need to be during regular business hours also made it difficult as this means taking a number of hours off work. Being open on Saturdays isn't sufficient.

Would recommend design and Muskoka HAVE to be at the same time, back to back. We had conflicting schedule the first time but it got resolved.

Overall, great experience. Kudos to all the staff."
TAM0411109,"Our sales centre experience went very well. 

Our design centre experience was quite negative. As requested during our first appointment, we returned to the design centre and completed our selections on our own time. We spent over 10 hours selecting our choices. We were ready for our second appointment with our designer! She was quite negative to our selections, and was not knowledgible on any of the products we had questions about. 

During one of our visits at the sales centre, our sales person told us we could remove the 'Tamarack' brick from the exterior of our home once we arrived at the design centre stage. Once we arrived at the design centre, our designer told us this was not possible. We had to return to the sales centre, where steps were taken to grant our request.

We would not recommend this designer to anyone!"
TAM0813117,"No, nothing to add."
TAM03182037,"There were issues working with the company Concept Homes.  I did not find they were helpful nor did they respond in a timely fashion in order to complete my selections in time.  

Also after the framing walk-through, it would be nice to get a list of the deficiencies identified and when they were remediated.  I have not see this yet."
TAM08191005,"There was a pricing options, a lot of them did have enough of a price range on them."
TAM0317117,"*More follow ups
*Make sure contactor had most recent updated agreement with full list of updates from either Ottawa office or design centre. Such information should not be provided by client directly and this request will only rise concerns to clients to worry more."
TAM01181010,I wouldn't change anything; the sales and design centre processes were great!
TAM0610121,The design centre is understaffed. The process to choose options felt rushed and was not as enjoyable as it could have been.
TAM0816116,I don't want to change anything.
TAM0211110,"I think maybe the communication between sales centre, and design centre could improve."
TAM0913101,"The sales process was very fluid and linear, however the design centre process could have better communication, especially in terms of having to contact our own sub-contractors for our upgrades in the home."
TAM0110109,"If we could change anything about the sales or design centre it would be, to maybe provide frequent non-generic updates of the construction. 
Also, if a home is on the boarder of becoming an inventory home, the purchaser should/must be made fully aware of that, to avoid limitations to their construction."
TAM1015101,The problem does not lie in the sales or design process.The problem appears to me that it is in the revised architectural plans (as per agreement with the sales & design center). Also it seems that this information is not given to Your subs (from your office) in time therefore framing wrongly and then demo all the work as per agreement plans! this happened to my unit and just can't wait for a walk through. In my opinion there is a break in communication in the framing process.
TAM08181013,"I think the upgrade price quotes process needs to improve.  Not only was my design consultant given incorrect information regarding an upgrade (which caused some unnecessary work on her and my part), but she had to submit price quote requests to head office so I only received the costs for the various tile upgrades, etc.  on my final paperwork.  It would be nice if she could have easier access to quotes and be able to provide it more readily to me so I can make choices BEFORE final paperwork.  I also had to keep checking the design consultant's work on colour sheets, etc. because even though I made a few changes in upgrades along the way, she made several errors which would have cost me money had I not caught the mistake.  Doesn't anyone else check it? 
 In addition, the design consultant could not explain how my design center upgrade bonus was applied with taxes as I could not reconcile to the numbers .  She could only say that the ""spreadsheet"" figures out the taxes with the upgrade bonus.  I had to trust that it was correct.

In addition to the design process, I had asked a question to my customer care representative regarding an inspection prior to drywall going up.  Apparently she gave me completely wrong information by saying that I would get one when design choices are done.  But I later found out from my design consultant that I don't get this walk through because I purchased an inventory home.  I think more care needs to be taken with regard to information being provided to customers."
TAM12191028,Hope the design visits can be combined in as minimum appointments as possible.
TAM01201018,N/A
TAM1111144,"Sales rep needs to be sent on a course on what is standard vs. upgrade. Valarie needs to understand that honesty is the best policy as we discovered many areas where she stretched the truth to give us the feeling that our needs were being addressed
ie: 4 car driveway. We asked this questions on at least 3 occasions and were always informed that the driveway can hold 4 cars, once construction began, it was clear the only way for the driveway to allow 4 cars parked would be if they were all Smart Cars. 
Both my wife an I were disappointed with this and a few other areas. I have been been in sales for 10+ years and have never once misled a client to get the result I wanted. We would have preferred to have 'gee I'm not sure, but let me jot that down and get back to you once I have the answer'"
TAM0413106,"Explain that the total quoted price does not yet include upgrades and other additional accesories such as dehumidifier, electronic/automatic garage door openers, etc.  especially for those who are buying a house in Canada for the very first time.  

This is because some houses sold in US come with appliances, so the expectations are different depending on previous experience(s)."
TAM10181035,"To be honest, the entire process was thorough and excellent."
TAM0515108,I wouldn't change anything.
TAM0715122,"We were a little bit surprised that we had to pay for some things that we wanted removed from the standard design (instead of getting credit for them) and still pay extra for some things that required much less material than the original design. Also we think that it is not fair that Tamarack charges $500 for ""drywall repair"" per floor (in the inventory home) when we requested pot-lights and TV conduit relocation above the fireplace. At this stage the house still is not finished and it's not like Tamarack had to re-do/fix anything."
TAM0214103,Nothing - every aspect of the experience was exceptional. Your company has a great team of associates in Orleans.
TAM12191022,The communication on setting up appointments were lacking - I needed to reach out to them instead of the other way around.
TAM0910114,"I would completely change the subcontractor you use for entertainment services.  We had significant difficulty in getting them to accurately depict what we wanted, and then they were completely unresponsive when we were trying to get them to correct it.  In fact, in our walkthrough, we found after having tried to get ahold of them for 2 months, that it was done incorrectly and had to get the vice-president of Tamarack involved in the resolution.  I would NEVER use Concept again."
TAM1015121,N/A
TAM10181030,"It would be better if more tech tools are involved for idea demonstration, for example, with AutoCAD. Often times, I had difficulties to visualize the design ideas."
TAM0812120,"""Blue prints for new home models with walk-out, to include mechanical location, need to be available to reduce speculation of furnace locations and ducting.
Both sales and design centre would benefit from computer generated displays of available options.  This would reduce guessing/anxiety by providing immediate graphic representation of selections.  These programs are readily available.
Walk through inspection with site boss could be more collaborative vice confrontational.  Client observations are concerns not criticisms."""
TAM0214106,"Knowing that we are limited to certain suppliers when selecting plumbing upgrades would have been nice. We feel that we were mislead on what our options were during the sales process. We were given the impression that all we had to do was provide the make/model info and we could have any _____(sink, taps, flooring etc) we liked for our home."
TAM1109101,"Please standardize and make the colour scheme denoting the level of an upgrade consistent for all products (i.e. floor tile, hardwood flooring, carpet).  The current scheme is very confusing (yellow-green, blue-red for carpet or blue, green, red for floor tile...).  Just pick one grading scheme for all products."
TAM1014117,"everythings was wonderful nothing to change Louise, Darlene and Kim made the experience of buying our 2nd tamarack both enjoyable and easy!!!"
TAM08191054,Please give me VIP on your next new development.
TAM1118117,Include list of dates of when the different processes will take place when signing the sales agreement. Processes such as estimated dates for design centre or frame walk through so that buyers can plan around those times.
TAM0711135,We purchased a model home therefore we didn't visit the design center.  Our inspection is scheduled for June 9th so some questions are not valid at this time.
TAM0713123,"First off, this survey does not fully reflect my experience. We had no design centre dealings at all. There should be a 'not applicable' choice.

The house we bought was listed with a realtor, through whom we 'bought' first. It had a sign in front of the house, was in their roster of listed houses. The sales person criticizes us during our officially sale meeting that we should have gone directly to the sales centre instead of going through the realtor. This was very conflicting for me and didn't sit well. Had the sign been a Tamarack sign, I would have gone to the sales centre. Why would I even think to go to the Tamarack sales centre if a house has a realtor's sign on the front lawn?!"
TAM1110123,There was no model of the home we chose.  As such many errors were made in design option we chose.  Fortunately they were corrected.
TAM0514103,"The staff was very friendly and helpful. However,one of the issues we had was that we were led to believe that the stainless steel appliances included were going to be high end quality which they are not. The other issue that came up was when we went to make electrical and plumping changes we were told our house was already dry walled and we would be charged extra. In the end our sales person and design center person went to bat for us and we weren't charged. I think there needs to be better communication within the Tamarack family so customers don't encounter these types of issues."
TAM02191016,"Sales rep, décor and office staff was great!   

Extremely disappointed with the construction rep (located at the site trailer) Mike.   He is an extremely rude person with absolutely NO respect, he is rude, loud and arrogant.   When we arrived they did not have my shoe size for the frame inspection, he didn't care and was totally rude. He was so rude to us that lost all interest to even participate  .... we just wanted to get out h*ll of there. 
We returned for our PDI and arrived on the wrong date,  Mike was extremely rude to us again however, did have the nice lady Wendy do the walk through with us.   Hard hat, safety glass and shoes are disgustingly dirty.
  Wendy is a very nice lady and professional.   Mike is giving your company a bad reputation.  Our family purchased 3 homes from Tamarack and this will be our last. I will never purchase a home because of the experience with Mike.  You need to replace him."
TAM1016110,"The layout of the design centre is less than ideal.  The standard (spec) choices are limited and in some cases, disappointing (for example cupboard hardware, stair rails, paint colours and bathroom fixtures to name a few).  There are too many upgrade levels and it's impossible to determine their cost during the active selection process.  It makes one cautious when making choices because you don't want to escalate your purchase price by $100K with a series of choices.  There was also nickel and diming on ""upgrades"" (for example grout colours cost extra).  However, we want to emphasize that all staff we met at the Sales Centre, the Design Centre and the Frame Inspection were excellent - cordial, courteous and professional."
TAM10191001,"Reponses or prompt responses from the sales team would be appreciated.  More time in the design centre, felt very rushed at the end.  Also I would prefer to pick my own tiles, etc from all the choices rather than have the designer choose just a few to show men and have to keep sending her back to try and find something. Also once I went back and looked at all the tiles myself, I saw something I really liked that I hadn't expected to like. My tastes or vision are not necessarily those of someone else."
TAM0614201,Cannot really think of something right now:)
TAM06181000,To be able to buy material ourselves as some pricing are just overwhelming
TAM1015108,"Software program for design centre so when choosing upgrades, the cost is automatically calculated (barring the custom pricing which requires a quote). Also if there was a visual, so if you chose a counter with cupboards, you could actually see exactly what it looks like.  Hard to put it all together when it's small samples. With technology I'm sure there is a program out there that Tamarack could tap into. Also, the design centre representative had an overdose amount of perfume on each and every time I went in and this made me feel sick. On the last appointment with her, I advised her of such. Afterwards she treated me with disrespect and made the remainder of our appointment unbearable. Furthermore she gossiped about it to the sales centre staff and I've been treated differently by them since that time. I understand that I had many upgrades, and quite a few changes throughout the process before I finally signed. I spent @ $50K in upgrades so it was a difficult process, which made it more challenging by the fact that I didn't get pricing on items in a timely manner, so changes had to be made later. Everything is fantastic now with the builder and construction crew. I was blown away with how fantastic Charlie was on inspection. He was extremely professional, and he appeared genuinely concerned with the process. He took the time to explain what will come next as well."
TAM1111129,Have the same selection of Standard Hardwood for Half Moon Bay as the other developments.
TAM0511124,"I found Tamarack to be completely inflexible on upgrades that I wanted because I purchased an inventory home. It was a complete money grab to charge me $500 per floor to install potlights! 

I had no say in where the cable/internet was placed. Also, I wanted to lower the half wall in the kitchen and again the answer was NO with no consideration for what the customer wanted .. and I was wiling to pay for the change!!!  You would not use my Benjamin Moore colour when I was willing to pay for the paint upgrade... and you were charging me an ridiculous price to paint but not improve the quality of paint.  Again completely inflexible in the paint colour.  Cleary design and decor are not a priority with Tamerack.

Howerver I did find Mandy Mason and Ewa to be outstanding.  Some of the best service I have recieved by any home builder.  They were both very helpful and professional."
TAM1012107,"A change we recommentd is that the basement drawings from the architech (vents, pipes, bulkheads) are available prior to a new model being released.  Unfortunately with our basement being the first to be completed, no one new this information until the day we signed off at the design centre which meant we had several important snap decisions on lighting to make and cabinet changes.  We may have a few imperfections due to the information not being present at time of purchase and signoff at design centre.  Even at the walk through, it was noted another bulkhead was present and we had to contact the cabinet builder to make another correction at this late date to our bar. As is, the cabinet builders can't commit to a final piece to our upper cabinets until the day they install them-hope the stain will be the same once we find out if there will be room for it."
TAM07181029,all staff contact has been ideal
TAM09181015,For design centre to be more clear on what home they are working on
TAM0414122,"Overall was ok, but I felt that there were some definite areas needing improvement. Not having a design background we would have appreciated more feedback on our choices than 'if you like it' or 'it's your choice' etc etc. We found that we really had to push to get the answer that was helpful to make our decision. Towards the end of the process we were able to get more constructive advice.  

Also, one other area was notable at the design center. The hours are to 7PM on a given night, and for most people coming from work this leaves a small window to look around. I found it therefore unprofessional when the lights were turned off at 650PM and the staff sat in the chairs by the door with jackets on. It seemed as if we were being rushed or encouraged to leave, something I was quite surprised at. Following this experience we never returned on an evening except for specific appointments."
TAM06171020,"There is not enough time from the time you decide to buy to the time the structural appointment happens.  In our case it was the same day, so there were some structural changes we wished we could have done but did not have enough time to fully think them all though before the deadline.  It is very hard to select things from the samples or to visualise size and scope of the house without having a model home available.  It would be nice if Tamarack had some 3D software that allowed for virtual walkthoughs or as we selected options have those options show on the software so you can get a better idea of what it looks like."
TAM1016122,"Very happy with all of our experience at the sales centre. Louise and Darlene in particular have been very very helpful throughout the entire process. We probably wouldn't have bought our home if it weren't for their patience and understanding. 
Unfortunately we had a negative experience at the design centre and with Muskoka. We felt that the process was rushed and we were not well-supported throughout. It took a long time to get answers to our questions and in some cases they went unanswered completely. I don't think this was the fault of our salesperson in particular but more a problem with the way the process is set-up and perhaps the volume of clients at the time. We escalated part of our issues to head office (a dispute over a quote we received) and in the end we were not charged on that upgrade but we were still never given an explanation or apology. Many parts of the design process felt like a guessing game to us and it was completely the opposite of the attentive and supportive experience we'd had at the sales centre. Overall we are still very excited to see our finished home and would recommend Tamarack."
TAM01201000,"Nothing, we were really pleased with both."
TAM0116101,"We did not get 45 days for our design centre selections. One of our appointments was canceled without our knowledge. Design centre pricing was inflated compared to Boone and euro tile pricing. When we had an issue with something we had no one to talk to we where told ""I can't do anything about pricing"" or ""that's up to head office"" and no one we could call. We got the feeling it was a pass the buck mentality and when we called our customer service representative she was not helpful at all. In fact we got the impression when speaking to her in our one phone conversation that she was very busy and no time to speak to us and was in a hurry to hang up. We feel there could have been more of an effort to address the problem directly instead of just passing the buck. It ended up wasting a lot of our time and visits to Boone and euro tile. On the other hand our sales consultant Joy went over and above and helped us with any issues we had. She seemed to be the only one who was helpful enough to persue any issues. Her service was amazing and we wish the rest of the experience we had was as good as the one we had with her."
TAM0915129,The counters in the washrooms
TAM1015137,I will like the have the blue print at my first design centre visit. I only got it at my last appointment.
TAM0614224,"The Sales and design team were wonderful to work with thus far.  My only suggestion would be that buyers get a list of options that they get to pick/upgrade, if desired.  We missed having the opportunity to upgrade bathroom faucets as it never came up during our selections."
TAM0912117,Happy with both.
TAM0615115,The whole experience has been very positive for us so that we have no suggestions for improvement.
TAM0213114,"We have been given great service with our third Tamarack home in Findlay Creek. Richard, Kim and Scott have been extremely supportive and helpful. 
One suggestion: When buying from plans, whereby there are no model homes, the sales associates should discuss such things as where the bulkheads are."
TAM1013124,"Our experience started off amazing at the sales centre. The sales rep Sal and Louise were fantastic and a definage asset to Tamarack. From there unfortunately the experience slowly deteriorated. At the design centre Christine was able to resolve our issues. Although we were given an answer to our questions then signed off on the upgrade and were advised at a later date that what we selected (sink and faucet selection) could not be done. Our options that were given to us were pay more money for a combination that works or a refund. There was no compensation for the design centre rep's error. We were advised it was our error on the selection even though we specifically asked our design rep if there would be an issue with our selection. We were told our standard sink could come in a one hold setting for the upgraded faucet we selected. Granted it was not a completely horrible experience but one would expect a greater level of customer service with miss information. Once we got to the frame check inspection of our home the tamarck rep Richard was very short, abrupt and quick to dismiss our concerns. During our inspection there was what appeared to be human feces in our mudroom behind a door in a corner. We were told by the Tamarack inspector that it was animal feces. Nonetheless it was not something one would like to see when inspecting their home."
TAM1212119,Electrical selections should not be done on the last day.  Design Centre staff need time to get quotes and see if choices are acceptable by code.
TAM07181007,Allocate more time at the Design centre. At least twice the time currently allocated.
TAM1012108,"Ceramic quotes:

Tamarack representatives confirmed me that no additional fees (or double price) will be added to the ceramic price from any suppliers (Euro Ceramic in my case). 

I was surprised when I have received estimation: the final price was $1,600.00 higher than estimated (this example is for one room only).  

It is difficult to understand the difference in pricing because:
- Labour is already included (no matter if your ceramic is blue, green, yellow, red or black dot)
- No extra $ for layouts
- No extra $ for non-standard ceramic sizes 

I wasted two days for choosing ceramic that I have not installed because of high price (with some exceptions).
I think it is better to inform your client (before she/he goes starts to talk with suppliers reps.) that the final price for ceramic will be much higher."
TAM0811108,"1-Sales rep should be responsive to client requests and builder should direct clients to design changes based other neighbor choices e.g our Bradbury side windows are face to face with our neighbor Bradbury on one side despite that we asked for a window position change but our request was rejected by the sales person as we do not know our upcoming next door neighbor model and location of their building compared to ours.
2- The builder failed to notify us with the delay in closing according to the time frame in the contract. 
3- We were given very short notice (we have to come and see the house within 48 hours) before having the dry wall."
TAM05191018,"We’ve been so happy with our experience. Deb at Poole Creek, as well as Mandy at the design centre, were amazing to work with!"
TAM04191009,"We would have liked quicker responses to our e-mails, answers to questions and requested pricing. By the time we got all of the information, we had already passed our limit date for final choices. We do not believe this was the designers fault but perhaps an influx at that time of clients or slow response time from the suppliers perhaps."
TAM0712123,"A database with a list of upgrades for the Kingston site would be nice, similar to that used by the Ottawa sites.  That would make the selection of upgrades a much easier process as more work could be done ahead of the meeting without wasting the sales rep's time."
TAM1013100,I wanted to move the fireplace over by 4 inches in the basement.  I was told that Tamarack could not do it but could not get an answer from anyone as to why not.  The manufacturer indicated they did not see an issue.  I therefore removed the fireplace in the basement as there was no resolution to my request.
TAM0516103,"Sales woman was fantastic.  If it weren't for her we wouldn't have made the purchase.  The design centre, it was a nightmare.  They were never prepared, cancel appointments, never had anything ready.  Halfway through discussion she would just walk off for another appointment,.  We had to go to the sales lady to get things done.  We took time off and went all the way there but she would only stay with us for 15 minutes.  They took a long time to get back to us with answers and then expected us to make decision in hours rather than days.  I think the lady was retiring soon so I don't think she cared.  She would just say that we need things.  When I asked why she would raise her voice and just say we need it.  She is the reason why we graded 6 for recommending the builder.  The only reason why we would send anyone now to Tamarack is because of the sales lady."
TAM07191030,"The lighting in the design center could have better, and the showroom more professionally laid out with samples"
TAM0416101,"We felt that the sales person should have had a better understanding of the community development, the property and its surroundings and the upgrade options. We would have appreciated having Tamarack working more flexibly around our busy schedules that often see both of us out of town. At the framing inspection, our expectations of the Tamarack standard were higher than what was actually achieved, example - the concrete floor in the basement is not finished to a high standard. When we addressed the issue, we were advised that the matter would be dealt with at the PDI. We now have concerns that there will be other issues during the PDI that will not be finished to a high standard that we expect of a Tamarack home."
TAM1011114,"Nothing, the staff and centre have been wonderful.  I would say that our over all experience thus far has been outstanding and we are now just waiting to be able to see our new home!"
TAM0510135,"I would have liked to start the design centre process earlier.  I felt extremely rushed and having a few days to decide about a $10,000 upgrade isn't enough . 

This would have also allowed structural changes to be done while in the design process.  Many structural decisions can't be made until you know what you are doing in your kitchen for example.  We would have liked to extend the bulkheads in the kitchen or move certain walls but it wasn't until we were in the design process that those ideas occurred to us.  By then it was too late.  We bought the home in August and didn't visit the design centre until the end of November.  There's no reason for us to have felt rushed.

I would also have liked to make electrical decisions at the frame-walk stage.  It's very difficult to imagine where something should be; light fixture, television outlets, until you are in the home.  Although Daryle was extremely accommodating and ultimately had them moved for us, it would have saved everyone time if we just picked the locations while in the home (that's what Urbandale does; during the walk-through the electrician goes through the home with you and you get to pick where everything will go (keeping code restrictions in mind)."
TAM1012114,"For upgrades, such as exterior package, stairs, doors, etc, photographes of the items in a house setting will be helpful."
TAM0910126,More Handrails Samples ha ha
TAM05191004,"Great set up, Morgan was very friendly and knowledgeable!"
TAM1209120,to be allowed another week after the final meeting to add or delete items we added. We would have gotten more upgrades if we were aware of the overall cost during the process.
TAM09181006,"Have a program set up to allow us to envision what our design will look like with the colour choices, etc. Similar to a virtual interior design app."
TAM07181009,Provide the stadars materials in design center as well as upgrated so that a client can see how it looks like not just see in pictures
TAM0816121,I would like to see model homes with standards only
TAM0615127,"Open and honest communication with respect to delays in releasing the lot to us. Although we expressed serious interest in the lot, we were not able to secure it and therefore lock in the purchase price. Price rose by $14k from the time we initially started talking to Tamarack to the time we were finally able to purchase.  
Once the lot was released, process was great.  Having small kitchen set ups in the design centre would make it easier to make choices-hard to pick from small door sample."
TAM03191003,"Design Centre was very confusing. 
We went through numerous variations of selections,  when we finalized our selection the center lost our final selection causing us to go back and reselected our choices and constantly fixing  incorrect selections that was inputed in the builder system.
We provided a spreadsheet that was extremely simple,  we are very confused how this could happen.

Design area need focus on improvements."
TAM0514101,I was satisfied with the process
TAM1111116,"The builder should provide quality materials for the house they are building. The design center quality for standard materials should meet the size of house, example the railings,and the hard wood. The houses are expensive enough, and one should be able to at least get the worth of the money they are paying for the house. Putting caricature railings on over half a million dollar house, It's just on fair. In other words the builder wants people to pay  for a house and still pay for most of the interior items needed for the house. The builder should also send inspectors regularly to the site to follow up with what they are doing."
TAM0614101,Nothing in particular. My sales representative is Noella Francoeur. Noella is absolute treat to deal with. She has made the process of purchasing a new home seamless so far. I have purchased two new homes in the past (Claridge and Minto) and this easily the best experience I have had. A big credit to that has to go to Noella.
TAM0213100,"Nothing I can think of.  Perhaps more info on other options for alarm providers as we are left with no choice but this one.  Not a major issue but would appreciate more choices then one.  The staff at the Design center and Muskoka were very helpful and gave good advices.  Still happy with our decisions.  House will look great we are sure.
Regards

Gary Patry"
TAM0410103,"I think we would want a bit more information on what exactly must be decided before the structural sign off, which is quite early in the process.  There were things we would have thought about that we did not realize were part of the structural changes.  By the time we got to our design centre portion, we were too late to do somethings we'd thought of.

We never had a Blue Print Meeting, hence the 0's in that section."
TAM0610129,"1. Have concerns regarding regarding changes being given proper consideration - saying 'Don't worry' to us....& then having it wrong upon inspection.
2. Most standard options aren'y that nice....so everything is an upgrade to make it half as nice as the model home.
3. The model home 'oxford' was so lavishly done that understranding the real floor plan of the kitchen was visually impossible.
4. Paying extra for coloured grout was penny pinching considering the cost of the house.
5. Having pre approved lighting packages and tiles discontinued long after finalization of Design made for a disspointing return to again make decisions."
TAM11191029,We did receive some misinformation about the deposit at the start and rushed to the bank to get the full amount when realistically we only needed some and the rest was paid on a set schedule.
TAM1111124,"Our first sales Rep Tera was wonderful, very helpful and supportive.  Our second rep who we had to deal with at the west end of Kingston was not supportive, told us we weren't her clients although we had to sign everything with her.  After completing the structural and initial purchase with Tera, we were shocked at how poorly we were treated by the rep at the West end location."
TAM0915115,NA- I bought a spec home so there were not much for me to add here
TAM09181033,"Design center Appointment should be longer, do not have enough time to cover everything"
TAM06171023,"To better understand the whole process of buying a newly built home. The tamarack team, Jaqui and Carolyn, were very patient with us and helped us through the process and answered our many questions."
TAM05191001,It was a very positive experience
TAM0610136,"The only issue I had was that during the frame check the foreman was not there and it was someone else.  there were deficiencies found but not discussed by the foreman but by Deborah who tried her best to explain the issue.  At that point, I think that is out of her hands and it should be the foreman dealing with errors found.  I did not get a call on the follow up of the errors found, instead it was ME calling around to get answers and to ensure that the errors were going to be fixed.  This is an area that Tamarack needs to work on. I definitely liked the idea of the frame check, however, the follow up afterwards was not ideal at all."
TAM12191001,Can't think of anything.  Everything was perfect!
TAM02201016,"We were pressed for time during the design center process due to back-to-back vacations of all members involved (design consultant, Muskoka cabinets rep, and lighting group). Would suggest better coordination between these functions or better vacation coverage within each function."
TAM0810104,Have the sales and design centre at the same location.
TAM1118121,No happy with the décor consultant at all.  She did not offer any help other then agreeing with all selections we made.  She had absolutely no knowledge  about design and upgrades nor did she offer any benefit.  You are tarnishing your reputation with hiring such college design experts.  I will recommend the builder to my friends and family if they change their décor consultant or at least educate them.  This is my only disappointment.
TAM0612117,"More pictures of different styles and colour combinations in actual homes. 
Being able to have more than one walk through before closing."
TAM0614110,"We've purchased two other new homes in the past and we had heard good things about the quality of a Tamarack home.  We found the purchasing process very frustrating and disappointing.  We weren't expecting a home builder with a quality reputation, and in context of how much we were purchasing, to nickel and dime us on every single upgrade/change. There was no flexibility whatsoever considering we were spending over $150K in upgrades.  In the past, our homebuilders would ask us for a list of all of our desired upgrades/changes and they would come back with a quote considering the entire package and we could add or delete depending on our priorities.  What frustrated us the most was the lack of credits or discount on replacement upgrades for anything we deleted, including a window, backsplash, closets and some smaller items.  We also found the purchasing process with some of Tamarack's suppliers to be terrible, notably the fireplace and alarm companies.  We booked an appointment with the fireplace company (which had no evening appointments) where we had to take time off work but then the rep failed to show up, wasting our time off. In the end, no fireplace upgrade because we couldn't get any service.  The alarm company returned our call three days after she said she would - again decided against doing any business with this company.  Rogers never called us either.  To end on a good note, though, our Sales rep, Sal, was phenomenal and took the time to explain Tamarack's supplier relationship so that we weren't quite so frustrated."

TAM1010113,"I would recommend that communication between sales/design ctr/site needs to be improved. Individually, these three components acted superior to my expectations but  there is a lack of communication between these entities which resulted in mistakes that could have been prevented."
TAM08171015,I've had a wonderful experience so far and I wouldn't change a thing. Deb in the sales center is a fantastic woman and really made this experience easy for me during a rough time.
TAM08191015,Nothing
TAM1014115,Staff in Design Centre is not professional and efficient.
TAM09191011,Wished I could have made minimal changes since I purchased 6 months prior to possession
TAM1112126,"The Design Consultant was great but, I think asking someone to choose colours,etc.9 months before move in and the cement isn't even the ground is not good.
Allocate more time.
Be flexible.
Have to sign off on structural at time of sale but, asking for you to make design decisions as far as colours at that time is unrealistic."
TAM1109105,Nothing.  Our experiences have been positive over the many years we've dealt with Deb Durie and the crew at the design center...Christine and Sherri
TAM0714101,Worked very well for me. Thank you!
TAM0516100,Deb and Mandy were fantastic!! Other than not having a model of the St James at the time there was nothing I would change.  So far all your staff have been a pleasure to deal with and we have enjoyed the process! Thank you! Chris and Lori
TAM1116107,"- Sales Reps - Only good things to say. Great experience. Good and accurate information. A pleasure to deal with.

Proposed change: None

****

- Follow-up post sale - Not sure who coordinates - Full marks for going through the motions: Sending us an email more than 3 months before closing to inform us that the PDI will follow in a few days was a little odd.  

Proposed change: Send PDI notice at a more relevant time. Perhaps a few weeks before the planned PDI. 

****

Kitchen cabinet coord - Poor coordination. Rep went on vacation after 1st meeting and returned the day before design firm up. No calls or email returned until day before signature meeting. 

Proposed change: Ensure staff is available when time constraint are imposed on clients (if you don't sign on this date, delivery date might be affected). Do not encourage clients to ask if they have questions and then not have anyone to answer queries. 

Cabinet measurement discrepancies – different layouts were provided. Some with conflicting room measurements. We had to go to the property and measure the space ourselves to confirm which layout used the correct dimensions. Being told ""things should sort themselves out"" falls a little short on expectations.  

Proposed change: Staff should be able to resolve discrepancies. Clients should not have to step-in to sort these out.

****

- Design Center - Poor coordination. Some questions remain w/o answer. Poor experience is mostly not related to the rep that assisted us.

Proposed change: Don't know. Systemic issue? Feels like this is normal design center everyday operations from what we experienced. 

- For several standard items, there is no mention of what will be installed. Some info was provided by your design specialists, some info we know is wrong, and some standard items will be a surprise as no one came back with answers. 

Proposed change: Provide clients with clear list of standard items that will be installed including manufacturer and model numbers (the upgraded items list is well defined. Need to do the same with standard items).

- Upgrades mostly perceived as money grab from a consumer perspective. Some items sold as upgrades only differ in colour and retail for the same price at local retailers.

Proposed change: For upgraded items, ensure there is an actual upgrade being offered or at least some value-added.

- When asked about where we could obtain paint colour swatches for the standard Tamarack paint colours. The answer: Unknown. No offer to find out either. After looking around town, we now know Tamarack colours are standard CIL colours and swatches are available at Home Depot or any CIL retailer. This would have been great information.

Proposed change: Don't know ?? Tamarack staff should know ??
 
- During our interaction with the design center, within the span of a few days, individual item prices on the upgrade list kept changing in Tamarack's favour, sometimes three times the posted original amount. This was somewhat ridiculous.

Proposed change: When on the last stretch with clients, prices presented should be ""stable"". Not fluctuating daily or hourly.

- We inquired about the difference between items on the upgrade list marked “options” and those marked “upgrade”. Staff could not explain. Still don’t know. 

Proposed change: If these words have no meaning for Tamarack, it might be a good idea not to mention them on your upgrade list.

- Questionable prices - One faucet upgrade we were considering retailed for $170 regular price at Lowes (print out provided). Tamarack offered the same item at the freshly updated price of $340!?! When we asked Tamarack staff, the explanation given: the installation needs to be factored-in... comes across lacking credibility since nothing is installed yet in the property and I figure the default faucet must have included installation.

Proposed change: Align your prices with retail or offer price match when items are offered locally with such disparity.

- Custom Shower upgrade. Between supper time on day 1 and lunch time on day 2, the price went up $2000 (no change were made to the original quote and no explanation was given as to why the sudden change) - Another odd moment. Plus the added bonus of reception staff rolling eyes when we declined this latest updated offering.

Proposed change: ?? don't know what to say ?? Last attempt at money grab??"
TAM0314103,LITTLE MORE INFORMATION & PRECISE INFO IN COMPARISON WITH MODEL HOME & REAL HOME AT SALES CENTRE
TAM0712121,"The Sales Representative needs to be aware of the cutoff dates for modifications before making promises to the buyer.  On several occassions, we requested changes.  We were told that they wouldn't be a problem and then had a follow up e-mail saying the changes were not possible.  Accuracy in the price breakdown was lacking.  We are now on our third version of the price breakdown."
TAM0614213,"I would have liked to seen more flexibility with regards to selections not offered by Tamarack. Such as kitchen and bathroom fixtures. Also, the costs of some upgrades were over the top and I personally could not rationalize them."
TAM0414110,"Better communication between the sales rep and the design center rep? There were a few small items missed,cable missing, light put in the wrong spot when we did a walk through of the house with the sales rep. When we enquired a few weeks later if this had been resolved we were told by the sales rep to contact the design center rep, not sure why we did the walk through with the sales rep if she could not ensure the changes could be made? Overall this has been an excellent experience and I have thoroughly enjoyed the process! I have absolutely no complaints and if needed would purchase with Tamarack again in the future."
TAM1110109,"We had a very positive experience.  I wouldn't change anything about the process, everything went really smoothly.  Everyone we dealt with was very friendly and extremely helpful.  

Overall we are happy and very excited to be moving into our home shortly!"
TAM0816100,"None that I know of. Everyone at the Sales Centre and Design Centre are very pleasant. I would really strongly recommend Tamarack. Beautiful homes and quality, excellent (heard from previous and current owners of a Tamarack home)."
TAM11191016,"No, I am satisfied"
TAM0311103,"More examples in the design center
More choices of the exterior of the house
Communication of the progress of the construction can be better"
TAM0915125,"Nothing...it all went quite smooth.  Darlene Louise, Ewa and Christine were all very helpful, Knowledgeable.  Only one negative.  By the time cabinets, doors, painting, installation is done there are a lot of dings and scratches, etc."
TAM0516110,"I was completely satisfied with the sales and design centre process, I would not recommend any changes."
TAM0916105,"A more integrated experience. Meaning some things were done by other sub-contractors and thus very often our questions were either not satisfactorily answered or differed to tamarack.

Also a lot of selections were no visual components. So we couldn't see what we wanted visually."
TAM0913123,"Being able to have some flexibility with the purchase price, having up to date information when purchasing the home (ie selection of outlets). Having more time to think about selections made at design center and beingg able to be aware of prices for ugrades quciker. Lost a lot of time in decision making,waiting for quotes."
TAM08191008,"The first thing we would change is the time allotted during the design process - 3 visits is NOT enough time to choose everything for a big house and get the info needed to make our choices.  1st visit(orientation) is fine but the 2nd visit requires way  more time in order to ask questions and seek out all your options.   We also only received our price list 4 days before our 3rd visit - leaving us NO time to get through it all.  I would strongly recommend a 4th and even 5th visit to finalize everything in person or at least provide customers with that option. 
Secondly, there should be a more accurate and complete listing of the standards and options available (in the catalogue and in the design center).  We shouldn't have to search the internet to find that info ourselves.  
As for the sales process, we would like more honesty and more open communication in regards to expected closing dates and delays.  A brief letter stating a 2nd closing date with no apologies right at the 120th day before closing was very insulting.  We get that sales reps are following protocol - so that being said, Tamarack's top leaders are the ones who should be more considerate of the enormous disruptions a delay in closing date has financially, physically, and emotionally on a family.  Providing accurate information earlier would be very helpful and less stressful on everyone."
TAM0812133,"The choice of standard hardwood floors is not sufficient or equal among all home communities.  The options for the Meadows Homes did not inlcude a dark floor option, while other home communities did.  I spent money upgrading my floor just to have the colour wanted-dark stain (e.g. chocolate)  Given that oak is the standard option for all of the floor options, how hard would it be to add a darker stain to the list of options?  You should offer the same standard options at all home communities.  I realize you have different suppliers for diferent communities, maybe that is the problem.   Imagine being at the design centre and seeing a 'standard floor' only to have the rep say-'that's not standard for the Meadows homes...only....home communities.'  I was not at all impressed by this. It is something I bring up when discussing Tamarack homes wth others."
TAM1012127,Design Centre - have more illustrations that you can see for ideas.
TAM09191046,I would have liked to have been told that eaves trough were not included also Cogeco incentive no longer available
TAM0714118,"Process is fine, but the cost of upgrades is at least 50% over one can find on their own."
TAM1110129,"Offer one or two other choices for the kitchen cabinet supplier.  Was not impressed with Muskoka service / advice, and choices.

Offer at least three choices of bathroom supplier.  Boone and the other supplier are very expensive."
TAM01181003,C'a pris beacoup de temps pour construire ma masion depuis Avril  jusqu'a janvier
TAM09191040,Larger and up to date granite samples as they small sample isn't a good representation of the large slabs.
TAM0611110,"The design consultation is very paper-intense and dependent on the designers notes.  It was awkward working through all the paper, 'whiting-out' errors, scribbling in margins, etc. and it led to design consultant errors on the day of signing off on the upgrades.  There should be a way to do that online, both for the customer who can then build a virtual set of upgrades and get a sense of cost, and for the designer so they can update info in real-time."
TAM0612129,"The thing I would have liked to see was more options for the basement 
(bradburry) and possibily a model house with a finish basement to give us an idea."
TAM12181001,At the design center ( have more choices in the standards ) other than that it's  all good
TAM06172001,"We were very happy with our experiences with the sales centre staff. 
(I only indicated '5' on the questions regarding design centre appointments because we did not make any selections as our home was fully completed before purchase)."
TAM0517109,"We can honestly say that we cannot think of anything we would have changed from our experience with Tamarack. Everyone has been very pleasant and helpful, not to mention very quick to get us answers to the questions we had."
TAM1013108,Nothing for the sales center but I would include more options in the design center.
TAM0215100,"We thought the sales experience was superb, Jacqui Collier is a fantastic saleswoman and very giving of her time. 
The ability to have 2 people in the office to answer questions regarding both aspects of sales and design would be an improvement. We found that if Jacqui wasn't present there was nobody to answer any questions regarding the sales aspect."
TAM0717102,"The design Center staff was very helpful when I already bought the house. Prior to that stage, it was a long time for me to get an answer from the receptionist. I kind of thinking that Tamarack must be understaffed! 
I think buyers need their questions answered before they can decide whether they should buy a house or not!"
TAM1110112,"-Option catalogue for models available for viewing at sales office
-1 standard & 1 options choices kept on file so if option is not chosen the standard choice was recorded and thus can be used.  No waisted time finding it.
-Receive a carbon copy of item"
TAM1210115,Great product and service! Keep it up.
TAM09191044,"Provide upgrades cost sheets and upgrades info and what the choices /options are right at the initial purchase stage (many people know they definitely want one thing or another at this stage) as we had errors due to picking our upgrades with decor person at a stage that was too late for the construction stage for it to be passed on in time.  Some things like bath upgrade or inserts need to be selected well before this stage.  Also it seems that there is a disconnect between the people ordering and doing the work as the offer and upgrades are not being read and acknowledged properly because I had to point out several errors that needed to be changed.  
The other thing I would change is allowing for changes that customers want to customize this homes and focus on saying Yes rather than always saying No to requests.  I got the feeling during this process that the builder felt that they cannot learn and better their drawings and homes from their customers ideas. In order to keep your finger on the pulse, you should be open to and listen to your customers changes and preferences because their beautiful home represents Tamarack and free advertising to future potential buyers and to happy customers and positive reviews. I also felt that only Dealing with the one sales representative Jacqui, seemed to be more difficult because she seems to have too much power and didn’t feel that she cares about the buyers.  Maybe she is just too busy. But we felt that whenever we asked for something, she generally would respond with a no answer and we felt as though we were a pain for her and she didn’t value our money or that we wanted a home done as we would like it so we would be happy customers. It didn’t feel like like the buyers and tamarack were on the same side with the same goals — which I think is to provide customers with a beautiful home they will love and be happy with and walk away feeling like it is a positive relationship that they would be happy to work with them and buy from tamarack again.  Not just about tamaracks bottom line.  Maybe there is not enough competition and sales are brisk and they can afford to be cavalier about their relationship with their customers, but if the climate was different and there was more competition and they didn’t own all the lots, this treatment of customers would be different or they would not get the sales.  
Further the design centre needs to be much bigger with more sample in a bright setting, not in a dark basement where none of the colours actually look like they do in proper light.  The pictures of choices of doors, fireplaces, tubs, faucet upgrades etc should be posted to view.  The design centre should also have a program and a computer where they can show their customers kitchen colours and changes immediately to assist with visualization and proper selections. Also to encourage upgrades and much more beautiful homes than the basic standards. Offer to provide lighting upgrades.  Lets face it no one wants those standard cheap lights.  offer to install customers lights by their certified electricians if a purchaser wants to upgrade, so she they move in they can be excited about their home.  It looks beautiful and a step up from the standard home builder the minute you walk in the door.  And you can say I loved dealing with Tamarack, they were so customer satisfied focused and paid attention to our wants and requests to ensure we upended up with a beautiful home and we would love to deal with them again and recommend them highly to our friend and family and acquaintances. During my house construction when I would drive by by to take a look at the various stages of construction, I cannot tell you how many future potential customers asked me about my home and experiences this far working with Tamarack.  I had to be honest.  I’ve built several new homes and I have had much better experience with other builders who were much more accommodating and easy to deal with and felt like they cared that I was going to be happy with my home."
TAM0911110,"The service was excellent. The staff is very knowledgeable.  So far, the experience with Tamarack has been excellent."
TAM08191048,Check and follow up.
TAM03191021,Everything was great.
TAM0816115,"In the sales office, provide accurate descriptions of what constitutes an upgrade and cost estimates. I was considering a resale of a Tamarack home and brought in pics of the resale for the sales associate to price all of the upgrades visible in the pic. About 60% of the upgrades were missed (e.g. t.v. above fireplace, outlet and cable conduit for t.v., blower for fireplace, crown molding, stained pantry door (which is not even available anymore), etc. A $15000 estimate should have been a more than $40000 estimate."
TAM0614104,"The Sales and Design experience was incredible. I have purchased over 10 homes in my life and I have never had such a positive experience. Louise Weegar and her sales team at Findlay Creek are true professionals and made buying this house a great experience. Mandy Mason at the Design Centre had excellent suggestions and certainly went the extra mile in fulfilling our needs in selecting all of our finishings and options for our home.

Honestly there is nothing I would change in the sales and design process. This has been a very positive experience and I would highly recommend Tamarack to any of my friends."
TAM1112105,"In regards to the design centre process, I think it would have been beneficial to have two short appointments with the design consultant, rather than one long appointment to make our selections. It was difficult and overwhelming to select everything during one visit of three hours. Luckily, the design consultant was very knowledgeable, helpful, and patient with us."
TAM1113120,Ensure that selections that have been discontinued are removed from the samples available for review at the design centre.
TAM06171006,To let us know about the front doors so we understand the standard door is glassed one. Now we have to dress it up!
TAM09191013,"More communication for those outside of the Ottawa area,  taking the time to explain the home buying/process that are first time buyer in Canada and new to the province/country.   More interaction with customers is required."
TAM0112105,To make it easier for customers who are not sure about what upgrades they want. It would be beneficial to have a layout or a detailed list or pictures of the upgrades in the model homes so the customer can have something to compare too.
TAM0717118,"Sales - Even more customer centricity, customization ability.  Initially I was a bit irritated by the sales process.  A customer should never feel like the builder is doing them a favour. I had remind people that as a customer spending +750,000 dollars that I should have more influence and less pushback on things I wanted.   I hated hearing, we don't do that, rather than a better way of explaining to the customer.  Overall once things were signed, I felt the process improve, although it was not without bumps in the road.  Talking with friends who had been/were Tamarack customers, was that the sales process hasn't changed in a long time 10+ yeaars.  They had the same commentary.  I would say that I am ultimately happy with the people I'm dealing with and that they ultimately are great people to deal with; Deb, Mike and the rest of the team.  Way better than some of your competitors, like Minto.

Design Centre:  I love Mandy Mason and Ewa at Muskoka.  Fantastic people to deal with.  The process needs to be more high tech and the ability to get information in a timely fashion from suppliers could be improved.  It was a great dealing with Concept and Bill Bachand, but it was slow in the design centre getting information from them.  The ability to lose options in the process of finalizing them was too great and wasn't perfect.  Too close to the stage where option mistakes couldn't be fixed.  Luke Seargant at Boone was fantastic as well.  

Suggested improvements
1 - A plan provided to the customer should be exactly their elevation and layout.  I had to fix my own drawing to get my house.
2 - The design centre document needs to be done electronically so the customer can have a running total of the total cost of the house and upgrades to keep to a budget.  The process is too slow and its hard to review option costs on paper instead of a spreadsheet"
TAM1112107,Some of the upgrades (such as countertops) were exceptionally expensive.  Otherwise the selection was reasonable.  It was very helpful to have the price list for common upgrades in advance of design meetings.  However it would be worth clarifying some of the descriptions.  Overall very positive experience - this is my fourth (and hopefully final) new build and the best experience so far.
TAM0811104,Nothing so far so good.
TAM0913120,"Deb Durie at the Sales centre was extremely knowledgable and helpful and gave us some great suggestions and ideas.
We cannot thank Mandy Mason enough for her design advice, her helpfulness and her overall great personality she is a real asset to the Tamarack team. She really went above and beyond to answer our endless requests and question.
Steve the site manager was extremely helpful and approachable. He addressed any concerns and questions that we had with the framing inspection. 
We have been really impressed by Tamarack's customer service and the dedication to providing a high quality product, and putting the customer first.
Thanks, Suneil and Anita Dham"
TAM0713118,"I wouldn't change anything. 
Note: The 5 answers are because he bought a home that was already built."
TAM1112121,A little more notice for walk through home.
TAM0712122,"I would suggest creating a spreadsheet that purchasers can use that includes pricing features as well as taxation and credit calculations.  This would be very helpful in keeping the purchaser on budget while making selections.

Some combination/package in terms of cabinetry, tiles, countertop would be helpful in narrowing down choices.

Purchasers should be given a clear option of leasing or buying installed equipment, such as water heaters.  We were not satisfied in our interaction with Reliance, the chosen supplier."
TAM1015128,Not much Valerie surpassed all expectations and was very accommodating
TAM0612110,can't think of anything
TAM0512104,n/a
TAM0614118,"Electronic design visualization tools - iPad design software (e.g.) for kitchen and other design elements (floors, tile, etc.).  The addition of this software would greatly increase the design centre experience and decrease errors.  It would also increase turn around times from design / upgrades for pricing and getting the plans into the hands of the construction crew.  Tamarack should have additional suppliers for products such as countertops, plumbing, etc.  The single of option of Cambria quartz, and the extremely high markup per square foot by Tamarack is a bad representation of the market.  Other than these criticisms, working with Tamarack has been a very good experience.  We will be Tamarack cheerleaders.  Thank you."
TAM06171027,I am happy with sales centre process and but I am not sure about design centre process. I hope they are as customer friendly as sales representative.
TAM1112103,One reason for my low scores in some areas was partially my fault. I had the time for my appointment to review the agreement wrong and the sales rep fit me in to her busy day. In hind site it was not a good idea as I felt rushed
TAM04191007,Nothing
TAM0717107,Location of the design center. Perhaps a little more centrally located.
TAM06171009,more visits to the new house
TAM1016137,"During both the design centre and sales process, we were rarely able to get answers for many of our questions. Most of the time when we asked questions we were told to call someone else, so it was difficult to track down answers to our questions.

There were not many standard options at the design centre to choose from. The standard hardwood, granite, and cabinets had few selections and they were not appealing. We were also limited in our upgrade choices for our hardwood because we could not pick from half of the hardwood choices at the design centre. We liked a hardwood at the design centre but it was from a different supplier that we could not pick from. This meant that we had to settle with a hardwood that we did not like as much and was a lot more expensive. When we went to the Tartan design centre in the past, they had more standard selections that were more appealing and their upgrades were more affordable.

The design centre scheduled our first and second appointments only one week apart. This meant that we had very little time to come up with our selections since we were supposed to have everything picked by the end of our second appointment. Since we had to rush these decisions, we ended up not liking them so we had to come in many times on our own and make decisions without the help of the consultant. The consultant also made many mistakes in our sign-off sheet so we had to keep sending her corrections.

The design centre was also very inconvenient to visit since it was mainly open during daytime work hours so we had to take time off of work to go there and they couldn't make appointments around our schedule."
TAM0914109,no
TAM0711111,"We were very pleased with the overall process and the level of professionalism.  Many choices were available. Not much negative other than some of the prices for upgrades.  As an example, the hardwood railing that comes standard in the Quail is normally more expensive than the more modern square post for which we had to pay an option.  This is a bit deceiving but it is our choice to pay or not."
TAM0716100,"We were very impressed with the service overall so far, so no we wouldn't change anything. I want to add also that the reason we bought the house is the planning and the green space in this development. It's something that you don't see anymore. Great job Tamarack!"
TAM04191026,The pictures or mock ups of the homes online and in brochures had white brick which is somewhat misleading as the house itself does not. I would change that so it’s not misleading to others. (Eton modles and townhomes)
TAM04182017,Having to made upgrade choices knowing eg. price of tile before sending it to make prices..for a specific model
TAM1015102,"Found the process overwhelming with many too many choices and an unclear process. There should have been better communication between the kitchen designer and the design consultant.  I asked questions of the kitchen consultant, but was told to ask the design consultant.  When I did that I was told that I should have asked the kitchen consultant and she seemed annoyed, as I was supposed to finalize my choices that day. When I received my initial e-mail on the design centre process there was supposed to be an attachment but did not receive that.  Spent days being given a runaround trying to get back to the whoever had sent me the e-mail.  The e-mail address I was given didn't work, so made several phone calls.  In the end I got through to the person I needed, only to be told that I could have just gone to the website to get the same information.  Overall found process frustrating, poorly communicated and not one I care to repeat."
TAM1110125,"The experience was not worth while and the costs are extremely jacked up, Tamarack is no match for the customer service as my previous builder. The design centre failed to return the calls and some time I do feel that your protocol is not worth as per the money we are dealing with you.
Prices have not been clear and all features are termed as upgrades while in my present home they were standard. In the nut shell I should say there is a difference between selling a $5 pizza and a half a million house, which I dont see dealing with Tamarak."
TAM0516108,"The sales experience requires change, it was difficult to obtain answers and there was high pressure to write a check before answers were forthcoming.  Everything was usually answered with ""we talk about that later in the process"". It often felt like things were being hidden and if we didn't ask the right question we would be left to find things out by surprise.  The attitude presented was ""the homes will sell, so we don't have to cater to you"".   

I would change anything with the design centre experience."
TAM0914103,"To have more pictures of the standard materials used for a particular model home.  While necessary to walk into a model home and feel good about it (because of the upgrades done to the model home) I would like to see pictures of what it would look like with the standard features.

With a clearer image of what a particular room (say the kitchen or bathrooms) would look like with standard features, it would make it simpler to make decisions about upgrading.

Thanks."
TAM0313119,THIS IS OUR SECOND TAMMARACK HOME WITHIN 1 YEAR. SALES STAFF WERE VERY WELCOMING TO OUR SECOND PURCHASE. DUE TO THE ESTIMATED TIMELINE OF OUR SALE OF THE FIRST HOUSE AND CLOSING OF THE SECOND HOUSE WE DO NOT THINK THAT OUR PRIORITY REQUEST FOR A SOONER CLOSING DUE TO THE SALE DATE OF OUR FIRST HOUSE WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY TAMARACK OR PROJECT MANAGER EVEN THOUGH A WRITTEN REQUEST WAS SUBMITTED MONTHS EARLIER FOR A SOONER CLOSING. BEING A SECOND TIME PURCHASER WE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MORE OF A PRIORITY TREATMENT I THIS REGARDS. WE DO NOT BELEIVE THAT THE PROJECT MANAGER GAVE ANY EXTRA EFFORT TO MEET OUR REQUESTS. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS REGARDS EXPECIALLY WHEN IT CONCERNS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. IN CLOSING MY ONLY DISSATISFACTION WOULD BE IN THE LACK OF EFFORT GIVEN TO HAVE THE HOUSE COMPLETED SOONER.
TAM0210124,"The sales process went very well.  The salseperson knew we were tight for time so sent an email to the design center to schedule our first appointment ASAP.  It took us a week to get a hold of the design center and our first appointment was made for three and a half weeks after that.  Because of this month delay we've had to push back the closing date.  It would have been nice to receive some follow up from the salesperson to get us in contact with the design center quicker.  In my opinion, if the design center is so busy that it takes a month to get your first appointment more staff should be hired."
TAM1110102,"A bit more time in the design centre process would have been good.  Muskoka was very slow with our changes and drawings which put us several weeks behind in completing the rest of our selections.  We also found it difficult that we selected everything only to find out a week later that most of our counters and some of our tile had been discontinued.  Not sure how to improve that part of the process, but it would be nice."
TAM09171016,"The only thing would be to have a list within the model homes of what the upgrades are (not simply identifying that the - hardwood - is an upgrade, but which one was selected) or have it readily available at the design center. It would be nice to have that information if they are upgrades you'd like to select for your new home. But that's simply a would be nice. The staff were amazing, very knowledgeable, helpful and extremely pleasant to work with."
TAM06181037,Everything is almost perfect.
TAM03182019,"I would like design centre can produce the customer's design in the computer, so customer can has more clear picture for their choices."
TAM0214104,Overall our experience and process has been a positive one.
TAM06181014,"More choices of colour (peint) for the entire house.

Better communication when you send your customer to Mondeau.....we had a really bad experience with them and head office did not help (even though they gave us 500$ at the design center) it doesn't compensate the difference....Mondeau told us that our upgrades should not cost more 1500$ when in fact the quote was over 6000$!!!

However, Mandy, Ewa, Darlene and Louise  were amazing!  We met Charles (foreman) yesterday and he seems efficient  and comprehensive!"

Valerie was great at the sales center, Mandy was amazing at the design center and Carla is continuously amazing during the rest of this process."
TAM0615108,Plumbing contractor abusive in price of upgrades
TAM1010115,"A few things.  Update templates for KINGSTON.  Every amendment or legal document has to be changed to reflect not only a different city but some legal nuances with respect to building permits and so on.  Have a Kingston template.

Provide customer with building plans to review.  Numerous issues could have been caught if they were reviewed.  After discussing intent to build large deck later, install chimney hood fan in kitchen, or other paid upgrades, it would have been obvious if actual plans were available to notice that structure was not being pre-located to support these 'owner installed' upgrades.  An earlier meeting with a Tamarack rep familiar with structural issues would have been beneficial as we were required to settle structural issues related to a fireplace before we had even discussed or settled on this interior design item.  Tamarack was supportive of making last minute amendments to address this latter item but turned down structure to support a future deck.

Tamarack and its alarm sub refused to pre-wire for an alarm system and the sub they forced us to use was, pardon the pun, sub-standard.  This issue was dealt with separately with Steve already however the customer lost out in this case as I will now be forced to install an expensive after-construction solution.

The relationship with the onsite foreman MUST be improved.  While we have been warned and advised by Tamarack that Mike is defensive and can be abrasive, its like walking on egg shells with him and it does not lead to constructive discussions or a good working relationship. The walk through I expected to be longer and more inclusive however on arrival it was rushed and focused solely on paid upgrades.  Again, if other issues were raised, first reaction was extremely defensive.  I would rather a friendly 'can't make any promises but let's look in to it' than a 'why didn't you raise this issue before?'(we didn't know it was an issue until we saw it) or 'is it in the contract?' (we thought it was!).  

The design center is looking much better now than when we started the process.  Having the majority of standards and some upgrades onhand to look at was VERY useful.  Some of the staff at Bathworks and in particular Grant's Tile were extremely unhelpful.  We have passed details to Tamarack separately.

Finally, there were strong emotions associated with the process of the initial down payment to hold a plot and closing date ( a key factor in deciding to initiate the process was a Sep closing date) and then to find out at signing that the closing date had slid a month with no notice until it was too late.  We carried on but it was almost a deal breaker and we felt like victims of a bait and switch routine."
TAM12181007,Overall experience is very good so far.
TAM0909102,"Design Center very confusing and unorganized.
This should be revised and looked into.
We realy didn't like the Design centre experience."
TAM1013119,"Extend the hours of the office, I work evenings and weekends so it was hard coordinating times to go to the office or design centre."
TAM0517102,No Changes.  Representatives were great.
TAM0211101,"-More knowledgeale design centre representatives
-Better organized display
-Accurate pricing for upgrades
-"
TAM0513110,"More details about what will be the cost of our house including Tarion, transfer tax and an approximate amount of our lawyer's fee in order to keep peace of mind throughout the purchase period."
TAM1210100,"Engage the customer more during the initial build process. For example, companies like Mattamy will send an e-mail to the buyer when the builder permits are approved, when the shovel hits the ground, etc.

Ensure that people are fully aware, and have some time (more than the 10 day wait period) to decide on all structural upgrades, if they need the time. I felt rushed on that end of things, and did not get adequate time to make decisions.

Better streamline the design process between Muskoka and the Design Center. Personally, we found differences in pricing between the two, even though we were asking about the same product/upgrade.

Get rid of AlarmBridge as Tamarack's alarm system supplier. We have never dealt with a salesperson who would harass us so much about setting up an appointment, stand us up for the appointment, then take no responsibility for it. It's a poor reflection on the company, and the companies that Tamarack deals with."
TAM0512112,Every thing is fine
TAM02191012,n/a...everything exceeded my expectations!
TAM1011133,"A bit more clarity of costs associated with upgrades, how the 'design bonus' works (i.e. we were surprised to know we were being taxed on this!)."
TAM1116113,"1.  More time to make decisions and review upgrades.
2.  An upgrade booklet that is actually representative of the prices and upgrade availabilities."
TAM0711118,"The services provided at sale and design centre are very good. Could not do the walk through inspection, being from Surrey, British Columbia."
TAM0912116,Clear information of upgrade products
TAM06171026,should give little more time to choose flooring and interior of house.may be take little samples home and come back with decisions.also we told we wanted  one extra window in basement which was not noted in structural changes.
TAM09191003,"More basic selection colours: hardwood flooring ( as it such s huge decision), paint again huge job, more basic colours should be available 
And available time in the model home for measurements etc - very limited hours to the model home, and when I asked to go for s scheduled time it was denied"
TAM1011113,Design centre - speed up the process of pricing out certain upgrades.
TAM1016140,NA
TAM11171004,"It would have been great to know about all the structural upgrades PRIOR to signing off of them and attending the design centre. Would of been great to have more paint colour options for the walls. Lastly, we have made several requests to know the exact final purchase price of our home in order to secure our mortgage to only be told that Gowlings (Tamarack's selling lawyer) will notify our lawyer a few days before closing. Calculating the total CMHC (if applicable), HST rebates and tax consequences of the build would be helpful before closing. We would also of enjoyed having a key to the home during the build or more scheduled visits to see the building process."
TAM0809109,To reduce the price for upgrades and add more variety.
TAM1014119,"Nothing , it was a great experience overall. As a first time home buyer the general experience is overwhelming, but tamarack helped make it enjoyable!"
TAM0716103,Customer service with Muskoka Centre wasn't fairly well when we were not really sure with our choices and needed more help outside of our appointment or
TAM12181002,"The sales and design representatives are fabulous!
The terms and conditions Re: Purchase Agreement are plentiful and regardless of what I purchaser, very few companies spend time ensuring purchasers understand their  50 page agreements.
My low rating for referring or recommending Tamarack to others is because of construction delays. This is my first time buying a new build. I was referred to Tamarack because previous owners of multiple Tamarack homes spoke highly of Tamarack delivering  all of their previous homes on-time. This coupled with my own research led me to purchase a Tamarack home. Being able to differentiate itself from other good builders, particularly with being able to deliver on time, is a huge selling feature.  In good conscious, because time is money, I am telling friends that while Tamarack is a good builder, but they cannot count on its past reputation of delivering on-time."
TAM1114103,Choose all the upgrade of or choice
TAM06172007,A descriptive list of next steps and dates upon purchasing the home
TAM10171019,"I think more transparency during the sales process would be better. We were pretty informed and did a few visits to the design center before signing, but this was not necessarily something that was offered, it was something our realtor recommended and organized. More transparency regarding upgrade pricing in the sales process would have also meant a faster deal for us, as it took quite a bit of effort on our side to try and price things out to remove uncertainty before signing the contract."
TAM1116109,"feedback about kitchen designs  we would give pictures and ask questions and two weeks later we would hear our answer after several emails and several calls and then when we went to the meeting about our kitchen design the consultant was not prepared even though we had sent several emails about the design we were wanting  and then we were told we have to close off or you will be delayed on your closing. if we got answers to our questions in a quicker response time we would not have been having to call and be stressed about meeting the deadline. poor communication between design centre and sales people. no central point of contact. our daughter bought a few years ago and did not have this problem. We were not told who to talk to or we had to figure it out ourselves and things would come up that design centre would say we could do eg. change our sliding door from right to left, 3 weeks later we would find out we coulnot do it after we were told we could so did not think it was a problem. same as our shower we had purchased a upgrade and a few weeks later we were told we could not get that one. This should be known at time of purchase. Definite lack of communication. We would be told to contact sales staff and we would say cant you do this with regard to the sliding door."
TAM0613122,All upgrade options should be able to decide during the design centre. Currently some options are no longer available once passed the sales period.
TAM1209122,"The Sales Centre staff was very welcoming and helpful.  Everyone seemed very knowledgeable and excited to work for Tamarack, which definitely helped us in selecting a builder.  Valerie Taller represents Tamarack very well.  

The Design Centre process was extremely overwhelming, particularly given the tight time frame that we were afforded in order for our closing date to remain in effect (keep in mind that we did not purchase an inventory home and Tamarack selected our closing date).  In particular, we felt very rushed by our Design Consultant, who, on numerous occasions made a point of reminding us of her 'other' appointments.  Choosing colors and styles is an exciting part of purchasing a new home, which we have done on two other occasions in the past, both times with excitement.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with Tamarack's Design Centre.  On a more positive note, Sheri, from the Design Centre was very helpful and accommodating."
TAM0216100,"Scheduling the pre-delivery inspection has not been a positive experience. We were called and given one date. Efforts made to reschedule or explore a different date were met with resistance and curt responses. There should be more flexibility in this process. The reason we are able to buy an expensive Tamarack home is that my wife and I have full-time jobs. Moving into a new home has already required time away from work, at a cost to us."
TAM1113108,"Nothing.
Overall, I think all Tamarack service persons were friendly, knowledgeable and professional. Made our first home purchase a great experience so far."
TAM1016135,"I received emails several months in advance of when I was actually called into the design centre. These emails indicated that I would be notified of my design centre appointments very soon. I had contacted the design centre to ask about approximate dates of when I would be called in for my appointments because I was trying to plan other commitments around that timeframe. There were several unanswered emails and phone messages from the design centre front staff regarding this question. This was frustrating. It would be helpful if they were more responsive going forward. Being a homebuyer, it is not acceptable to have multiple messages go unanswered. 

In all other respects, my experience so far has been very good. The sales office was awesome, even with answering questions months after the purchase of the house. The design consultant and the Muskoka designer were also really knowledgeable and accommodating."
TAM1014100,"Everything is very strict. For example, I bought a unit for which choices had been made but they were not at that stage yet. I had to put a lot of pressure of have some features changed. 

No walk through of what the kitchen would look like (am not talking about cabinet door and hands), talking about lay-out of kitchen.

There was an exact replica of my unit in the next building, basically at the same stage of construction except that the choices had not been made. They could have used the options of my unit for this unit, thus allowing me to choose my options."
TAM11171022,More communication in regard to the status.  I only received one e-mail to date saying the foundation was started.  I drove by recently and see that they are moving along quickly though.
TAM0614203,"N/A, my experience with Tamarack has been great to date! 

The people, the service has been a very pleasant experience! 

No recommendation at this time, 

Thank You!

TAM0811118,"When you are looking to make structural or design selections, it is difficult to visualize how it will look, it would be nice to have better way to visualize the changes and how they will appear.  Some sort of 3D imaging would allow buyers the chance to visualize the changes and understand any potential unanticipated consequences.  Failing that, greater flexibility in adjusting for unanticipated consequences would be great.  When you spend $500 - $650K on a home, you want it to be the home of your dreams."
TAM10181015,"I would like to see a more accurate example of the interior finishes in the design centre (I.e, the upgraded shower in the design centre was not what was put in our ensuite bathroom - we were not advised in advance that site conditions might impact whether the shower is flush with the tub surround, like it is in the design centre. This should be clearly communicated earlier on in the process.) Also, we were very disappointed in the standard soaker tub that was installed in our ensuite bathroom. We had seen a photo of it before finalizing our decisions re: interior finishes; however, the actual tub is too narrow, and had there been an example of this particular tub in the design centre, we would never have chosen it. We discovered these issues on our framing walk-through and notified Tamarack that same day of our concerns, but by the time we got a response, we were told it was too late to switch the standard soaker tub to a different, upgraded tub. Our design centre consultant was on vacation during that time and when she returned, she immediately spoke with someone at head office to advocate on our behalf to have the issue with the shower fixed, but she was told it was too late to put in a different tub. The design centre consultant and the Muskoka Kitchen consultant we dealt with were excellent; I think it’s a matter of having more samples of standard and upgraded items in the design centre and advising customers that what they see in the design centre may not look exactly the same in their home depending on the model/site conditions. The salespeople and the foreman who did our walk-through of the framing are also excellent - very helpful and responsive to our questions and concerns."
TAM0610135,I was a disappointed about my closing date being changed.  I also found the design centre to be very confusing and that not enough time was given to make all the choices.  I also found them to too busy to finalize my kitchen design.
TAM06171013,"I absolutely enjoyed both the sales and design centre processes. However, if I have to change one thing, i would say I'd like to have a bit more time with the designer at the design centre. I felt that both appointments with the designer weren't long enough. Given the size of our home, we had a huge list of selections and we had to make a couple of hasty choices towards the end of the appointments. We ended up having to follow up after the first appointment to make adjustments. The designer was very accommodating. However, this could have been avoided if we had just a bit more time with her initially. Overall, great experience. Thank you"
TAM0610102,The opportunity for a second inspection between frame inspection and closing to view upgrades ie: custom tiling and kitchen cabinets to ensure they are as  client requests.
TAM1011129,"Make better use of the first design centre appointment so that the buyer can start making selections.  This will give more time for selections to be solidifed and if anything needs to be priced, the buyer will have the prices before the last appointment and still be able to make changes in conjunction with their budget.  Also, it would be better to not have to wait for pricing on ugrades (unless its a special order).  If its on display at the design centre, it should already be priced.  Finally, there should be more time given between appointments (with other buyers) so as to eliminate the feeling of being rushed for the buyer.  Three hours as promised is fine, but the buyer should get to use the full three hours if necessary.  Since there is no where else to put this, I must say I was extremely pleased with Deb Durie and her sales team.  They ALL did a fantastic job and I would buy another house with them anyday!!"
TAM0915109,"The sales centre did not always know who would answer questions - whether it was part of the purchase or a design centre issue.  The only point we were very (very) disapointed with is that we are downsizing into a townhouse and we were told that there was no way to get a french door instead of a patio door.  We wanted to avoid the after we purchase type of renovations.  WE are getting quartz installed in kitchen and all bathrooms after we move in as your upgrade prices were just to expensive.  Quartz through Tamarack $14,000 - purchased after is $6,000."
TAM1214102,None.
TAM1010100,Nothing!
TAM1212116,When she bought the house she was not told that she would not be able to pick her brick.  It wasn't until after the sale and she asked when she would be able to pick the bring.  She does not like the brick that her house will be buit with.
TAM0317114,Would prefer more options or selection in flooring and kitchen samples in base price .
TAM03182032,Be allowed more visits with the designer! Having one appointment with the expert to decide everything is a lot. It should definitely be split in two visits.
TAM07181018,Design Centre should be open some evenings.
TAM0513116,"Its the Maskoka cabinet company has made little mistakes that could have been avoided.  Hardware has been uneven but its being fixed.  Tamarack has wowed us every step of the was.  During the selection experience, the tile selection process was a bit of a pain.  They would have to keep getting quotes each time for the upgrades and that made the process very long."
TAM07191015,Not being misinformed so many times. My sales rep was very rude.
TAM06191017,"There were a couple of things we weren't informed about.  We talked about if we could have a fireplace up and down stairs but it was never mentioned that we had to make a decision right away.  The other was adding a water line for behind the fridge,.  It was never discussed."
TAM08191024,"The process to confirm changes at design at the design center and choices is long because the consultants are busy. I feel using a web form or app would make it easier for both the customer and consultant to avoid repetitive manual work and confirmation and also to get a visual online of the choices vs. a paper form. This process needs to be updated to modern times and not be stuck in the past causing inefficiencies. Also was not too impressed with the consultant for Muskoka who was not able to provide pricing estimates on changes that I would expect others to have made in the past. It was frustrating getting the turnaround on design changes and the pricing - would have preferred to get a response quickly based on their experience.

Also if would be better to just have a single point of contact and not have to deal with multiple contractor reps."
TAM1011132,"nothing, everything was great."
TAM0909108,"Our only dislike was with the security company, we didn't feel that we were provided with good service which makes us not have any confidence in the company so we have decided to take another one."
TAM07191012,better product.  example more exotic tiles more colors of faucets and shower. too standard for choices
TAM1212104,"Hand out with a list of things that needs to be done prior to my 1st meeting with them; appliances, select, purchase and come with dimentions.

Better hand offs between Sales and Design.  During my framing inspections, I was cought in the middle runnign between Sales and Design.  As a client of Tamarak, that should be an internal division and transparent to me.  If there is a division, then Design should be required to be present during the inspections - no exceptions.

Responsive to the items shown in the contract.  My offer specifies certain items, I raised concerns during constructions which were unanswered and now I am faced with dealing with these through Tarion and my lawyer - location of floor drain next to furnace - your contractor was using the old specs - where the furnace used to be located and not the new specs - where it is now located.  Very few builder are contientious about this item and believe it to be trivial - it is not when you live in the home and make use of the space."
TAM0510132,-We would have liked more than 1 day's notice for our frame check
TAM0413120,I will put the options and upgrades at the design centre. Having both at the sales and design centre is confusing.
TAM1211109,I wish there will be more model selection when I am upgrading my next home with tamarack
TAM02201025,nothing
TAM01191008,"Sales persons should know what they are talking about, and the decor center process should be more user-friendly. It is nice to see the materials, but if there is an option to chose everything in a tablet or an application that will save a lot of time. Decor center persons are very good with their stuff."
TAM06181003,More time with the designer at the design centre.  I felt rushed and under pressure to make selections quickly when considering only the time provided with the assistance of the designer.
TAM1115115,"I would certainly appreciate  that, once all papers are signed and ratified by Tamarack and Design Centre, customers do not receive notes indicating that some items ( upgrades wanted by the customers )were left out and need to be paid for. It is so frustrating because it affects the customers' budget.
Tamarack and Design Centre should double check carefully and make sure that all upgrades are included in the contract and paid for."
TAM1013134,Not have so many option in the design phase and make the standard options of higher quality.
TAM0412103,A little more time between the initial meeting and the time to make selections would have been nice.
TAM0317115,"Would like the opportunity to see the progress of the house more often.  
 Felt like the variety of standards being offered is limited forcing you into an upgrade."
TAM04171020,Have design centre provide sufficient time to customers according to their needs especially first time new home buyers.
TAM08191018,Would have liked to have had te opportunity to visit the unit during the finishing stage at not just 2 weeks before closing.
TAM0913105,"When buying our home, the process was very smooth.  We initially pointed out a conceren for the instalation of a Murphy Bed in the basement of the Cambridge.  We were advised that it would fit and it would not of been added in our options if Tamarack could not install it.

The same concern was brought up during the frame check.  Our concern was acknowledged giving us the same response as before.  Adding that the Muskoka designer wouldn't of approved it, if it wouldn't fit.  A few weeks later once the walls were closed, we were informed that the Murphy Bed would not fit on the desired wall, because of the bulkhead in the basement.  With some disappointment and compromise we came to an understanding.  

I reccomend that included in the blue prints, are the ceiling hights, this including all floors of the building, including bulkheads."
TAM03182014,N/A
TAM0610112,"Kitchen pers. a little unprepared/disorganized for our first meeting. There was no guidance as to what to choose, or select. Would have preferred for them to have a little design background. Would have like to have suggestions made as to what type of cabinets could go in place of what was offered, etc... Luckily I have my own ideas, but I still found it difficult. I can only imagine what the experience would have been like for a first time new home buyer who had never designed a kitchen before."
TAM0711130,"maybe have more time for decision making on selections, we went several times on our own, however, the rep had really great ideas which helped us to achieve our design goals.  We got the impression that reps maybe try to squeeze in many appointments in a short time, and we realize it is a long process...  Many another rep?  

You have very knowledge staff working in your ottawa design center, and everyone is always ready to help."
TAM07191001,More communication about construction schedule and status updates.
TAM1115100,"when I did the frame  check walk through, more information could be given at that time the person present  was not responsible for the work. The design process I thought of options afterwards like features>sub floor in the basement under the carpet. I thought of it after and it was too late. It is an question of comfort and this was not suggested at the time. They may want to offer this to client - maybe people are not asking for it but it should be provided. The whole process was nice. By the way the sales lady recognized me from a previous home buying experience 37years ago. She knew exactly what I needed and within 2 hours I was signing papers."
TAM0816124,More standard options or just more options.
TAM0110101,"For sales centre process, there should be more help from sales centre staff on possible structural options available/possible, because as homeowners it can be overwhelming when trying to think of all the possible structural changes to make (ie changing mudroom window to a door for side yard access)."
TAM08181022,"You guys are not clear at all about what you get as basic options.  There are very small unclear pictures of the basic options then you have very clear high res pictures of upgrades.  I feel that this is a trick to entice customers to pay extra and upgrade.  No one, including the design rep, can show you clearly what the basic options are.

The walkthrough was fine and we picked up 4 errors.  Richard, our site sup at the time, noted all down and promised they will be corrected.  But they were not corrected and the trades continued. Had I not gone in the house on a later date, unaccompanied, these would have never been picked up and corrected.  They made silly mistakes, such as putting the dryer vent in the cupboard under the laundry sink; and installing a full wall instead of the $4,000 dollar upgraded half wall for the master en-suite.  I found out that the reasons for this is because there are any proper site supervisors for Poole Creek and they are mostly in Findlay Creek.  And Sarah Mayer nor Carla Mason could give me absolute assurance about the possession date.  So far, experience with Tamarack is quite bitter and I don`t think I would recommend anyone to you."
TAM10171028,Nothing.  I truly feel that Tamarack is at the top of their game.  This is my second Tamarack home and my husband and I have been pleased both times!  We are looking forward to continuing the building process!  :)
TAM1010109,"We have really enjoyed our experience thus far, the only thing I would mention is that we have not been offered an inspection of our home. We were told at the sales centre and the design centre we would have the oppourtunity to walk threw our home during the framing stage,  our drywall is now complete and we still have not recieved an invitation. 

We are disappointed because we have noticed that some of the changes that we have paid for (ie; the wall againest the kitchen island ) the drawings have not been followed. We feel this could have been avoided if we had been given the chance to walk threw the home and we are now hoping that anything that needs to be rectified  will not effect our closing date. 

I look forward to hearing from your customer service rep.

TAM0613120,"More Kitchen cabinets and designs to look at...In Kingston, where we are, you should be given the option to go to Ottawa to see the kitchen design center there......We did it on our own and are really happy we did. So much easier to make the decisions upon seeing the actual product instead of samples..Ewa was a fantastic help.."
TAM0515109,"I think the creation of a roadmap of the all the steps and timelines would be very helpful in order to visualise the process. I find that we are always waiting to hear what is our next steps and what we should expect. Having this when we sign would better allow us to plan for visit, appointments etc and to anticipate the next steps.

I would also like to say that Darlene and Kim are fantastic. I have truly enjoyed working with them both."
TAM0717119,"Sharing my design centre experience:

Tamarack could make better use of the technology to educate customers like us. For example, the design consultants should be provided  ipads  or similar devices, which could be used to demonstrate to clients how our homes would like after the upgrades. This is the norm in the construction industry right now.
As a client, without the ability to visually see how the upgrades would look in my new house, it becomes very difficult to image and was worrisome experience for me."
TAM1215108,Regret some of the design choices made. Really dislike some the choices. Will likely sell next year because of extreme dislikes
TAM1010116,Both processes ran smoothly.
TAM0614216,Maybe a little more recommendation regarding interior upgrade choices especially for people who have no experience with interior design
TAM0816130,It was great ! I would not change a thing !
TAM0615131,Opportunity should be given to do  the  changes to the selection. Dedign centre atleast have all standard things. Design centre appointment time and # of appointments should be increased.
TAM0416113,"Faster scheduling of design center appointments
Electronic tools to help see what my house would look like with different options

Mandy and Deb were both awesome!  They made it so easy and helped so much!"
TAM08181024,"the sales and design centre were absolutely fantastic, nothing to be changed here"
TAM0812131,Maybe a little more time in the design centre as there is just so much to choose from.....or this should be mandatory for the women to complete and have a separate bar/lounge area for the guys!!  (just kidding)
TAM1112129,"need to allow more time(4-5 visits, each visit 1-2 hr) for design process."
TAM0210123,Sales centre rep more accessible.  Make it easier to determine what are upgrades in the model home and the total cost of the upgrades in the model home.  The design centre process would be better if it included more than one selection consultation with the design rep.
TAM0516106,"The only customer service I've received is from the sales office, design centre and my on-site inspection.  
I contacted Tamarack on October 3, 2015 inquiring about my agreement of purchase and sale and asked for a review of my purchase price and offers provided.  To date, after numerous emails requests by me asking for a review and meeting, I am yet to have this completed by head office.  I have escalated my emails directly to the President and am yet to hear from him.  I have expressed my concerns of the lack of customer service after spending approx $400,000.00 on my home.  I am appalled that such a reputable builder has shown no regard for my inquiry.  I would not recommend Tamarack for these reasons and regret my decision for choosing them as my builder.  Perhaps this survey will generate a meeting."
TAM04191003,"The staff at the office and design centre were fantastic, helpful and knowledgeable. The only disappointment we had was with the quality of the construction of the unit. My husband and I are realtors and have good knowledge about homes and there are issues in the quality of the construction that were not adequately addressed .
We reached out to the office and the site superintendent to correct them. We realize that they have a tough job and  there are shortage of quality trades people available,  it is a challenge on the home construction companies but if you notice deficiencies and not fully correct them that is disappointing."
TAM0812106,I would have liked another week before having to sign off on the design/upgrades.  The Sales office  once I committed to purchase were not as quick to respond to my emails/questions.
TAM08181005,"A chart with all of the timelines would be beneficial.

Other comments:
We experienced delays with the sales representative and design consultant where they had to consult with head office. An example of this is in our upgrade price list where it seemed that hardwood floors could be installed in the basement at no additional cost. We were informed that it was a typo, but it took several weeks to get a response. On a side note, we felt that Tamarack should have still provided us this upgrade given that it was the price we were provided.

We were fully informed by Tamarack as to what we should expect from a framing walk through. Furthermore, insulation was already on the walls and the plastic barrier on the ceiling which seems contradictory to the name of the inspection. We were informed by the design consultant that we could make tweaks to the position of lights during this walk through. We were only able to obtain small tweaks after having pushed for it.

Vic took notes during our walk through, but we did not see the final product. Vic had also mentioned that we could visit the house anytime during the build, but that we had to contact Susan to make sure that no trades would be there which would prohibit us from entering. We tried to schedule a visit, but we were informed that we can only visit the house at the pre-delivery inspection. We were also informed during our walkthrough that changes to the insulation and plywood would be made that day, but when we visited the exterior of the house 4 weeks later, the changes had not been made and siding was already starting to go up. We don't know if these problems were ever resolved."
TAM04191004,"There should be another walk through after framing, to ensure finishes being installed are what was selected. The cost of upgrades seemed high, with relation to the base purchase price of the home."
TAM1009112,"In the design center, as a builder showing the Standard items to the buyer is your responsibility.
Most of the time we only saw the pictures or alike pictures.
For example: plumbing fixtures & faucets, showers, tubs, Fire Place, Lighthing fixtures.
Not seeing the standard items; made us frustrated during the upgrading process."
TAM0915131,Very nice people
TAM0615120,Everything is an upgrade which is very disappointing.
TAM0413100,More time at the design center. More time between the meetings and perhaps an additional meeting.
TAM1012121,"IMPORTANT: Basement is cracked (gap is widening and extending larger)and no mitigation measures were taken despite personal and written requests.
Quality of wood used in framing is substandard;
General workmanship during frame construction is very poor. wood frames (vertical sections, and trusses were broken/damaged at places throughout the house)
Design center activities need to be improved especially pricing of upgrades in kitchen. More clarity in providing upgrading details along with the pricing (itemized costing) thereof is required. 
design center activities need to be made relaxing less pushing."
TAM0513115,I would prefer dealing with the same person throughout the whole process rather than having to deal with several different people
TAM09191053,I actually do not have anything that I would change.  Both processes went effortlessly.  Very streamlined.
TAM10191030,"The electrical,cabinet and other upgrades should be coordinated by one single entity rather than three different ones. That reduces communication error.

The upgrade cost should reflect the market value more rather than being inflated."
TAM1011111,"The designer sold me a shower door that ultimately did not fit the shower stall that was the only option I was given.  It seems to me that the design centre should know what they are offering.  In the end I was given a very short amount of time to change the shower choices and I felt very pressured.  Now I am regretting the last choice that I made, which of course ended up costing me more money even though it was the fault of the design centre.  When I spoke with the site inspector when I did my framing inspection about this issue he said that he has told them a number of times not to offer the maxx kleara door with this particular shower stall because it does not fit but the design centre continues to do it.  

I am more than a little annoyed that I have to pay for their mistake - it would seem to me that they should own up to it and offer me the changes without any added cost to me."
TAM0515112,We can only comment about the sales process as the house was already built.  It was great.  Deb Durie is really knowledgeable and easy to ask questions to.  We are looking forward to the next steps.
TAM0313110,"During the design process, my husband and I had a number of questions around custom items (e.g. rounded corner beads, mosiac tiles, etc) that were brought forwarded very early on in our discussions with the Designer.  We were very disappointed that the final costing figures were not provided until the day before our final sign off as we were forced to make last minute decisions to accommodate the Design Center as opposed to our vision for our home.

I believe that this was an isolated incident; however, I would hope that other Buyers are given at least 48 hours to review their final costs."
TAM0413119,"The blue prints should be in the same orientation of the house.  The one we got was a mirror image.  More options for colours, exterior colours, more options for electrical.  Standards are limited. Or let us to bring own"
TAM10181003,Turn around time to fix items on PDI is too long.
TAM1216103,Nothing
TAM1115119,Everything is perfect.
TAM0213120,"The sales process was perfect. The design process should be more hands-on, where the design coordinator spends time with the client looking at options rather than ""look at all of the samples, write down anything you like and we will send you pricing."" A true design process should involve understanding the clients ""style"" or desired outcome and helping then find options. In the end we did get this but it actually came from the sales person who used some free time to do selections with us and in 2 hours she helped us selected the entire home! We were very thankful for Jacqui's help."
TAM1112115,to be allotted more time with a rep from the design center.
TAM0712114,Nothing and thank you for everything.
TAM0512118,"- plan review and walk-through available before/after work day hours, or on a weekend
- complete set of granite samples available in showroom
- tile samples separated: standard vs. upgrade, wall/floor vs. backsplash"
TAM09191052,Voice messages I left were not returned.
TAM1012128,NA
TAM10181047,"Design Center was great!

Not happy with the builder,  have owned 3 NEW build homes in the pass and this has been the worse builder to-date.   Many issues,  walls not painted, can see drywall squares on ceiling and walls,   shower makes a VERY scary noise that has been videoed by your reps (drywall needs to be removed in order to fix),  hardwood floors make ALOT of noise (can hear every step when on the first floor),  paid $7500 to upgrade wood stairs - horrible job,  construction not great at all.   A lot of issues that was noted on pre-inspection and not completed after moving in,  was advised by the inspector to not add items not completed on the pre-inspection items on the move-in sh

NOTE to Head Office:  Please call to discuss disappointment."
TAM10181006,"Very disappointed when walked into the house,  a lot of broken items,  staircase was not stained,  house was not cleaned, windows are dirty,  no remote for garage (still waiting),  wrong tiled on fireplace (hasn't been fixed),  More the 49 issues PDI.  No major items have been fixed.

Experiencing  issues with bbq gas,  hired third party to inspect gas BBQ pipe and it is not properly installed,  was informed that if the problem is not fix the gas contractor will have to put a quick release on the gas as it is  not by code.   Builder was informed,  the builder inspector said  the certified  gas person we hired was incorrect and didn't know what he was talking about. 

Builder inspect refused to document gas issue on PDI along with other items.   Not happy with the builder and would like issues fixed."
TAM0816136,Nothing.  If anything I would have preferred to have feedback about deficiencies that were pointed out during the frame stage walk through.  I would have appreciated if someone took a couple pictures to show that those items were fixed.
TAM0710109,nothing
TAM1012110,Design Centre - more time. Not as hurried process.
TAM10191029,Send more frequent emails about the progress of the house being built
TAM0915106,"We would have preferred to have been able to add a gas fireplace in the basement rec room as well as a number of pot-lights in the kitchen/dining room area, but because the framing and dry-wall had already been completed prior to our purchase we were unable to do this. Otherwise we were treated very very well and felt like we were a valued client."
TAM08191001,"More time and appointments are needed to make design choices, the design consultant should go through every inch and spec of the house, detailed spec sheet with all standard specs needed, detailed measurements needed"
TAM06161008,Everything went well. Thank you for a good experience
TAM0513105,Sales person should be more knowledgeable about what is standard and what is upgrade in the sales centre.
TAM06191029,I doubt there is nothing to change ... may be a monthly update on % of completion through the building process will be so good thing
TAM0816125,I would like to on Audocad rendering of the interior of the house we selected add have the ability to apply our selections and see them in the rendering
TAM02191006,Better accommodations with meeting times. They were often early and we had to rush from work to arrive on time
TAM1213108,I would recommend using a checklist approach at the design centre. There are too many decisions to make largely from memory.
TAM1010114,Nothing in particular.
TAM0513106,"I had the most trouble with was understanding when we had to tell them where to put plug outlets,etc.  It was like they skipped that whole part of it."
TAM0816108,"The sales center team has been great from the very beginning. 
If we had to change anything it would be to have meeting times offered for design selections that could accommodate those who have a hard time or unable to take off during normal business hours."
TAM0213116,"Wonderful experience. Love our Bradbury, now just waiting to move in. Thank you!!!!"
TAM1115104,To help client. Hopefully this survey will help with Tamarack refunding money for my flat tire that I got at sales office because of a nail. I emailed the President and then I heard from Debbie that they would replace my 1 tire. During the frame check I asked the representative to replace broken frame on second floor. I don't know if they did it because if is all closed up now. The front of my house on the roof was exposed for a long time to rain. I sent an email to replace that part I don't know if the replaced it.
TAM1113111,Nothing
TAM06171000,"Everything was pleasant, efficient and smooth!"
TAM09171012,"To provide more flexibility with the interiors i.e. kitchen, fireplace and lightening fixtures."
TAM1013103,"Nothing, staff is friendly, hours of operations are great for people who work during the day, lot of choices, and Muskoka staff is also great."
TAM09191037,Sale should allow customers modify the design more to suite our needs
TAM1116103,They provide nice quality homes and the design is well applied.  It is appealing and the finishing is good.  The R value is good.  The outside substrata was Styrofoam.  I was expecting it to be wood and was a bit surprised.
TAM1118103,Given more updates of construction process. Offer inspections during construction process.
TAM12191026,Everything was wonderful. I wouldn’t change anything.
TAM0710121,I found both ladies extremely helpful. Kim is a joy to work with and so helpful and Noella was always kind and considerate of my needs.
TAM11191013,I wish there were more sink and faucet upgrade options  available and also wish you had more trending and modern tile upgrades at the design center so i didnt habe to go source them myself
TAM0313122,Greater flexibility and more time.
TAM10191008,Sale and design centre was fine. It was everything else and higher management.
TAM0410108,More choices in standard features such as floors (ceramic tiles and woods).
TAM05181017,"Nothing, it was quite relaxed and easy. Jacqui and Carolyn were knowledgeable and extremely helpful!"
TAM0712110,"Nothing. 

My only real complaint is having to deal with Concept Home Theatre separately, especially since their hours are extraordinarily inconvenient."
TAM0317107,"I would like to have more information about my house standard. We purchased a townhouse from Tamarack 2.5 years ago so we assume everything should keep the same as the standard. However when we are having the Frame inspection we found the door side window changed, the ensuite tub changed(pretty small compare to the townhouse), the basement window changed. Those are all different from our townhome and we are not aware about it. I would suggest Tamarack to provide more details for the standard feature (include picture will be better).

Also, the kitchen drawings in the design center need to be update. We found the lights over breakfast island location are much less than the drawing and could not moved.

One thing I want to mention is the price for the upgrade. I think the price for the ceramic tile is ridiculous and there is no way to show us how the price has been calculated. The two tiles have the same price for the entry but $1000 different for the bathroom. Exactly the same size/style. I don't understand how could they get such difference and no one explains anything."
TAM1110119,"Our experience with Deb and Mike at the sales centre was extremely positive. They are so knowledgeable. We were very impressed with them.
Mandy Mason is incredible! She worked very hard to help us make our decisions in the short time we had. We really liked the way Mandy pulled things together; her great ideas really helped us. Every time we went in to the design centre, she had everything laid out ready for us. She has lots of patience and a lovely sense of humour which she uses very well. She is a well organized young lady. We are confident that all of our choices will be perfect for our new home because of Mandy's input. She is a treasure!"
TAM0715112,"The add ons are over priced, and the idea of everything is an add on. Also the standard is very cheap quality for the price we are paying for; towards the house."
TAM10191061,"to make sure whatever they do in the model home, make sure there's a sign that says upgrade. Ending paying the upgrades and finishing upgrades, let people know in the model."
TAM1015113,"I don't think I would change anything... I had just received a promotion in a new department and going through a separation so my schedule was not as flexible but everyone I had the pleasure of dealing with were very nice, helpful, answered my questions and were flexible. Big thank yous to Noëlla Francoeur, Joy Kerr, Sarah Taggart and Amanda Batten. Oh and now I feel terrible because I do not remember the name of the person who was there during the frame inspection.  Vic... very helpful. Took the time to show me everything. Super nice guy! Thank you. When I see the bus advertising ""Tamarack: Upgrade your life"", that's actually how I feel. Thanks!"
TAM1013114,"Closing date of construction was moved behind by one month. When originally purchasing the sales person told us the house could possibly be ready one month early, which prompted us to buy. This in total equalled a 2 month difference and caused us to have to find temporary housing for 2 months. A bit better knowledge of actual closing dates would have been fun."
TAM0915103,"Concern about where there should place there hydro counters, us it was wrongfully architect, this is causing us some grieve, it should have been on the other side of the complex, us our front door is on the side. As mention, there's not much  that could have been done, they are trying to make it look nice, again, they will show. My only request was to put up a fence and a roof, right now only a roof can be put up"
TAM04191022,"Wish the location of DC is closer.
I probably would put some 3D  pictures or videos view of the finish products for DC to assist the home buyers on make their choices.
same idea for 3D pictures of model home view."
TAM0516102,Everyone should have better communication between he sales centre and the design centre.
TAM10181005,"The inventory homes does not have provide any flexibility to the buyer for selection of upgrades from Design Center. The upgrades are already defined and even though they're not installed yet, the buyer is unable to make amendments."
TAM10191021,"clearer documentation of what is included vs not. Or more communication on what is possible. i understand you don't want to do ""custom"" but some wiggle room may benefit everyone!

not being able to choose an interior colour (the limited off white palette was frustrating)will create additional expense for me after possession.

Not having the ability to select my own lighting fixtures will generate additional expense. Surely Tamarack could have a supplier arrangement with a company to allow some choice!"
TAM0512105,"very good experience, mandy was excellent, patient, adn gave me lots of options."
TAM06181018,"1.)  The Standard range hood fan is white.  For the money paid for the home this should be an option of white or stainless steel.
2.)  The garage door opener should be included with the standard builders package.
3.)  There should be more standard builders options for inside lighting.
4.)  The should be an option to have more time to consult with the design specialist during the design process."
TAM1014125,As for a 1st time (new home buyer) it would have been nice to see the fully-loaded costs of the design selections we made. There was a catalogue and prices (no pics?)
TAM03182027,We were happy with all the process.
TAM10171002,Everything seems to work perfectly as is!
TAM0512107,"I was very happy with the teem I have met from the time I have
started negotiating the deel until I have sign the contract.
Sal and his secretary they were very nice people ( but they did not offer
us any cup of black coffee ( I`m jocking ) + Mrs Shiry"
TAM09191010,Pay your trades so they start caring about their work
TAM08181018,"They excel in what they do especially Louise Weager,Darlene, Rachelle, they are an asset to Tamarack"
TAM0914111,"Complete clarity on pricing. When changes have been made ( by the purchaser) new prices need to be clear. If anything has been exchanged in design i.e.  removal of doors from an office and the cost of those doors is absorbed to another area, it needs to be clear to the purchaser. There were too many surprises. There is a lot of time wasted with the kitchen design, although the design consultant was extremely helpful, there were some things that were wrong or contradictory with the Muskoka designer.
The staff that we have been involved with through Tamarac have all been exemplary and professional."
TAM0815103,We felt the overall process was very good experience. We have never bought brand new. Our other homes have been resale.
TAM0514100,"Nothing, we had a great experience."
TAM12171005,"Very positive experience overall.  Already had a chance to meet Rob, Finish Foreman who was very knowledgeable about the community."
TAM1215107,None at that moment.
TAM10171004,No comment
TAM04171000,"Upgrades properly documented on your price list are OK.  Upgrades where you quote a price are not.

You need to provide better explanations justifying the cost of upgrades.  Your process is slow, provides little information and leaves the buyers believing they have been taken advantage of."
TAM09181000,Nothing
TAM06171017,N.A.
TAM05191029,"Price for the upgrade cabinet and countertops could be transparent just like the contractors did. I have no idea where my money spend to so far for the upgrade cabinets and countertops. They give me a total price and refuse to give me any detail. Something like the material cost and labor cost, cost for per unit should be offered to customers in my mind. 

My family and I have bought 3 houses from tamarack and referred 1 friend to buy tamarack home in half a year. This is the third home I bought from tamarack in half a year and I would like to do the exact same upgrade I the kitchen. However, the upgrade price increased more than 20% in total. For some of them, like soft close hinge, price increased more than 100%. It is crazy big jump in half a year! I feel be cheated when I see the upgrade price list. This time is the worst buying expierence I have so far. I don’t want to refer tamarack to my friends now."
TAM12181017,"Front level staff are great but head office staff are not very friendly nor return calls or emails when questions are posed. Worse, they delayed the move in date for our home by stating that we did not submit our design requests on time. We very readily demonstrated this claim was untrue and found out that the head office was slow in providing quotes to design staff. Still, our forms were readily handed in on time. 

We would appreciate more honesty going forward."
TAM1112123,"We have some negative feelings regarding our sales experience.
Our story...

We walked into to the Tamarak (half moon bay) sales centre on a Monday and learned about lots 91 and 92 Abieti Ridge. At that time no sales associate informed us that it was possible to put a deposit down to reserve a lot. On the Wednesday, we were so excited to call and say we would like lot 91. At that time we were told another couple had put a deposit on lot 91 the night before. As we were not aware you could put a deposit down, we were very disappointed. Although we were uncertain and did not 'love' neighboring lot 92, we decided to going ahead with it.
About a month later we received a call letting us know that, for whatever reason, lot 91 was now available.  The sales associate offered to terminate our contract for lot 92 if we wanted (the more expensive) lot 91. The only catch was it would cost us thousands of dollars more than it would of, when we were initially interested in it,  around one month earlier. Furthermore, the sales team could not give us any reasonable rationale why Tamarak would not honour the lesser price. Our desire for lot 91 overroad our dislike of the convenient price increase, and we signed the papers for lot 91.

When we signed for lot 91, we did not (and still do not) understand why Tamarak would not honour the price lot 91 was when we signed for lot 92. 

Although we are very excited about our new Tamarak home, we have these negative memories regarding our sales experience."
TAM0716101,Could not say more positive things about Mandy Mason at the design centre. She was professional yet easy going and made the experience hassle free and actually enjoyable.
TAM12191002,Nothing so far
TAM04171022,Make the closing date a clearer issues and
TAM0714117,"There are lot
- We can't choose our own upgrades most of them we have to go with the builder...even though we don't like some of the features that builder provided.
- We are not allowed to do minor changes
- All upgrades are expensive comparing to other builders
- The hardwood which builder gives (basic) doesn't have much option, for sure everyone should upgrade.
-Design Center timings are not convenient.
- We have to pay if we need to add anything to home, but when we remove we are not credited. for ex: we removed a full window and we didn't get credit and just to add a curtain rod we have to pay $70."
TAM0312108,Provide more information to the client! Allow more time to the client for upgrades selections & during the walk-in process.
TAM02171011,"Structural changes should be minimized,however it gives customer the most satisfaction?Considering it involves personal preference,building code and budget. It can be more efficient by having a meeting with designer/estimator directly."
TAM06181019,more options and time at design centre process
TAM1116114,Everything's good!
TAM0213101,Be able to change carpet way before it got put in house.  Felt a bit overwhelmed having to finalize everything in one appointment.  Wish it could have been done in at least two appointments and not five months before closing date
TAM03182005,Design center rep need more knowledge about the products and cost.
TAM03182039,"Make sure that the sales centre provides the correct closing date to the clients before they put a hold on a property. Nothing to say otherwise, everything else went smoothly."
TAM0816119,"As a second home buyer with Tamarack, I am very satisfied with the services and would highly recommend them to my friends and family."
TAM1109102,"1. We did not have a blueprint meeting (hence my responses to that question).

2. I would start the design center appointments earlier, the 45 day deadline is very stressful when doing a large number of upgrades. 60 days would give more room to decide and get quotes from suppliers.

3. I would have liked to have been more informed about the possible upgrades available at the structural level. For example I did not know we could change our exterior to use stone instead of brick.  The catalog of options should be expanded."
TAM1114108,More time (appointments) to make selections.
TAM0510136,"Very happy with every one from Tamarack. Great service and great designs equals one happy customer. Not everything went according to plan, but nothing dose. Tamarack's staff were eager to solve any problems that came alone. Sales and design staff were not pushy and did not try to sell me something I didn't want or need. Can hardly wait to get into my new home!"
TAM1209123,"Questions 2 to 4 cannot be answered as our home was already built when we purchased it.  It was new and had not been lived in.  The person that had the home built did not become a resident here.  Therefore, the colours, design features, etc. were already in place when we purchased it from Tamarack."
TAM0912114,"- There should be more options available to allow the purchaser to economize when it's convenient for all parties.  For example, choosing flat (smooth) ceiling for one floor only should be an option.  Someone is already making the kitchen and bathrooms sm"
TAM0714110,"We had a really difficult time with the initial sales person, Tera. She is no longer with Tamarack though. We felt that she answered our questions incorrectly, never followed up on anything, was always weeks late with responses and flat out lied to us that certain things were included or standard that weren't. Additionally, three things that we asked her to document were still incorrect when we did the walk through. Everyone else was more than helpful, including Carolyn, Jackie and Mike. It would be nice if there was a more clear timeline or schedule of all of the different meetings, what their purposes are and what we should be looking for at those meetings."
TAM10181018,"It was quite confusing at design center initially since there is not much samples you can see and choose, it would be preferable to have more samples in the design center to aid the selection process."
TAM0913106,n/a
TAM1209111,"There were a few miscommunications early on and getting concrete answers proved to be a challenge at times. Otherwise, I would say that we have been happy in our dealings with Tamarack homes to date and are looking forward to our new home."
TAM08171019,Having clearer info about prices that we could take home rather than making decisions without knowing costs upfront.  We had to change our minds about a few things.
TAM08172004,The only real negative was that we are not local and purchasing while out of province.
TAM0314104,"to have knowledge able design centre staff, keep examples of color coordination, layout etc. for homes"
TAM0816132,The design centre process is broken.
TAM0911116,"I would suggest that the design centre hours be expanded. I found the process of scheduling appointments to be difficult, as the center is only open from 9am-5pm on most weekdays. Hours such as 1-9pm would work better for those people who work at 9am-5pm jobs."
TAM1015117,Pricing consistency of the upgrades from purchase of home to Design Centre appointments.
TAM10191048,"My purchase was of a pre-designed house with no room for mods.

Some of the sales staff came across as having a condescending disposition. Became better with time."
TAM0613109,Nothing
TAM0809112,Nothing.
TAM09191038,nothing
TAM0112101,"need more time, design consultant more trustworthy and considerate."
TAM10171017,I don't think that I would change anything.
TAM08181029,The ability to see the exact bathtubs that are offered to the purchasers of townhomes
TAM0517100,The biggest change would be that the client would be more aware of the cost of the upgrades. We found out only when we receive the confirmation of the upgrades.  One thing that did not help was the fact the Design Centre had just moved location so half the items were not on hand.
TAM01201023,Exterior options . Its should more modern.
TAM1009109,"We have inquired about stones a long time ago and we have been  have been misinformed that this was no option. Our next door neighbour (lot 3 in HMB) who reserved his lot after we did told us that he was offered stones because he did not like any of the offered bricks!
 All the respect to my neighbour; I believe we should have been offered the same. while I remember asking about the cost of this upgrade of stones and the answer was that Tamarack does not offer stones as an option. We have asked again on July 30, the possibility to upgrade to stones and we haven't received a reply.
About the design center, Kim is excellent, she has done an unbelievable job, very through, knows what she is doing, very friendly, gave enough time to choose and helped us a lot in our choices."
TAM0113106,"That all the other merchants had to be visited seperately and there was very little communication between them and Tamarack. For example, when we chose the silgranite sink from Boone we could not match the colour to the rest of the kitchen because it was in two different locations."
TAM04191002,"Would like to keep our comments confidential and NOT forwarded to Noella please:   Noella was good up to closing of the home sale however,  was not accommodating when scheduling Electrical walk-through.  Her emails where very unpleasant when advised that we couldn't attend the scheduled Electrical walk-through and not accommodating with offering alternative dates.  We would recommend our friends/family to Tamarack but not to Noella. 
Paul (Electrical contact for walkthrough) was AMAZING,  answered all question and was very pleasant to work with. 

We would like to discuss our comments and  open to discuss with someone higher.  Phone call is welcomed."
TAM0712116,"I found that we had to do a lot of driving around to the various places to pick out different things for our new home and it seemed like the people we were dealing with had no contact with the tamarack design centre and therefore were not clear on a few things we requested.  It would be nice to simplify this by having the choices for the fireplaces, plumbing, etc., closer together as to make travelling easier for the homebuyer.  Also, it would be helpful if the people at the locations had more contact with one another.  We would often be told one thing by someone, and then another by someone else.  This was confusing to us.  We were also unable to meet with the person taking care of the choices for the fireplaces, he was too busy for us and did not return our calls."
TAM0910124,"At the design centre, different levels of prices should be more evident for exemple the stickers were not on all tiles. The counters top prices were extremely expensive compared to other companies that we called. We found that there were hidden cost for exemple, the design of the cabinet to accomodate puck lights were expensive."
TAM10181043,"desiger at the Woodhaven she has to be more patrent when we wants to change some ideas,  few friends of me at east end were remind me few times check the agreement cos the designer will made mistakes, which she did made some."
TAM0710104,more accommodating hours at the design center; the design center was too busy and no appointments were available.
TAM1011104,"Initially, I was placed with a new sales associate.  She later quit, so I was switched to another associate.  I found that there was quite a difference in information and recommendations made by the more experienced associate.  Purchasing a home, especially my first home, is obviously quite an undertaking and I would have appreciated being placed with someone with more expertise from the beginning.  This switch also created confusion with some of the upgrades that I had wanted resulting in selections I had discussed with the first person not being transferred over.  This was obviously frustrating, so I would have changed that about my experience."
TAM0809118,"Three meetings are hardly enough to pick up the selections.
Design center is too far from Jackson Trails.
Choices are limited. Prices not marked. You need to select first and then cost is calculated. By that time you are left with no time to change.

I'll prefer to have the plan including the whole lot, the driveway, backyard and frontyard measurements (may be on a standard lot). It will give a much better idea and can be visulaized how the house will look on a premium lot."
TAM1112130,"If I was the boss, I will promote Kim but fire Ewa(from muskuka). the rate i gave in design process :1 is for Ewa (the worst) and 10 is for Kim (the best)."
TAM0812110,"""Everything went great. I purchased the home right at the deadline to make upgrades and so electrical etc had to be changed.  During the preinspection I am only concerned as to the amount of holes needed to be cut through new drywall to make so many changes throughout house to accomodate my upgrades (ie gas lines, cable and electrical add ons).  I'm not sure but I would assume almost all your buyers have upgrades so if I could change one thing it would have been to wait for a purchaser before going ahead with standards features etc.  There were too many changes to be made after standard feautures had already been finished. 
 As for sales and design centre staff... You do have a great team and they were always welcoming and knowledgeable and great to work with."""
TAM0610103,felt rushed
TAM04191011,"While sitting in the sales and décor center,  there should be informative videos while the reps are on the phone or helping others. Both the décor center and sale center need more education on what standard and what is offered as upgrades.  We spend a lot time waiting for the reps to find out answer while on the phone.  The reps should be able to answer most questions right away. 
A lot of wasted time.   
They need to be education on selection and construction. 
There should be an option to add items after  finalized décor selection, as sometimes we realize we would like a something more."
TAM0513119,"I think the worst thing for me is that when I went to the sales office I was told that the there was only one lot left and the next phase was going to be town homes and if I wanted to buy I need to buy that lot.  (which would not have been my option since it has a hydrant and utilities) I had explained very carefully to Deb that a large backyard was very important to me and my family.  You cannot image how devastated I was to see single homes with huge backyards become available less than 3 months after I bought.  It will forever taint how I feel about this home.  I have started thinking of moving out before I moved in and the associated cost of buying an Oxford with a larger lot.  As well, I was very very sad and still am that I did not get my smooth ceilings.  It was the one thing that I really wanted and I mentioned it first to Deb at the sales center and she wrote DC beside my wish list for certain items but it was so long between purchase (april) to going to the design center (october) that I thought I had already taken care of the smooth ceiling so I was really unhappy when I saw the stiple ceiling.  It is an overwhelming process and I wish someone would have taken my wish list and forwarded it to the design center.  it was confusing doing somethings with deb and others at the design center.  Another thing was that the stairs were not fully explained to me.  I thought the quote for the post was the one newel post for (2400$) not realizing it was for all of the posts, had I known that I would have upgraded.  I found Deb super nice till I bought then when I went in after I found out about the larger lots she was not so nice. This was supposed to be the house of my dreams, we were never going to move again.  But knowing that I could have had the backyard I wanted with Tamarack is painful.  Bittersweet."
TAM0815114,More options
TAM0913115,nothing.  it was excellent..
TAM1010106,Nothing
TAM1210118,Allow for changes to be made after the last design center meeting - perhaps charge 150 as other builders do
TAM06161027,"Design center team being just as enthusiastic as Jacqui. She was the reason we bought a Tamarack home. Jacqui's presentation to us sold us the first visit. Understanding that this is sometimes a first building a home, many people arent sure what to expect or don't know what others often choose for upgrades, changes etc. 
Overall your team is amazing. You do a great job and I have sent referrals your way!"
TAM06161010,Nothing.  It was all good.
TAM1212103,waiting in line to purchase the Lot#
TAM04171023,Nothing!  I was absolutely thrilled with the knowledge and level of service I received from the sales office and the design centre process!
TAM1113103,"Information at sales center was misleading. ""Bonus"" offer was turned and construed to make it appear as though the buyers were getting something additional for signing early whereas it was part of the standard features all along. It made the company appear dishonest."
TAM08181031,"Sales process was smooth and Marg was very friendly and helpful every time we visited her, always welcoming us with a smile. We didn't have the full 45 days for the design process, as it's my perception that Tamarack didn't handle properly the post-sales service. We had to proactively visit the design center 3 months after purchasing the home to inquire about when they will contact us for our appointments. It seems that we were contacted the week after only because we raised a flag about the short timeframe for our design process. Then, when we started with the design process we had less than 45 days to complete it, and we felt the rush to provide all the information and decide on things on a shorter timeframe, due to a lack of planning.

Our meeting at Concept wasn't a good one, not too much explanation on the things that we had to decide and what comes standard with the house. Also, no chance to change almost anything as most of the electrical wiring had already been done in the house, as per the Concept advisor, which didn't seem to be true when we visited the house for the first time. Also, no chance add a conduit to run cables through the wall in the living room area, instead they wanted to charge us per each HDMI cable that was required, which does not make much sense to me, but unfortunately due to the lack of options we had to accept. We will probably have to install a conduit ourselves when the time comes, if possible at all.

Ewa from Muskoka Cabinetry was very helpful in explaining our optional upgrades and assisting us through the process, however due to the lack of proper planning for our Design phase, we also felt the rush from her side to provide appliance models in less time than what was initially agreed on.

Morgan from the Design Center did a wonderful job and had a lot of patience explaining some of the options available for our home. I still feel that some questions were left unanswered, but we guess we will deal with those things after moving into the new house.

We were told that a Project Manager from Tamarack was assigned to follow up with us during the design process and solve any questions we may have. We only received a template congratulation letter in the mail after purchasing the house, and that was the last time we heard from the Project Manager at all. We are not complaining at all, but we expected more interaction if someone is assigned for this purpose, especially being first time buyers.

When we visited the house, some TV cable outlets weren't even installed yet, so we weren't able to confirm if we are getting everything that was agreed on. We also noticed that some of the electrical installations were recently performed (and still not completed) so it doesn't make sense that Concept didn't allow us to make any modifications to the original blueprint. A couple of potlights, which we were particularly very curious to see if they were correctly placed, weren't even installed on the day of our visit. We did receive protective gear (helmets), but not boots or glasses as stated in the survey, just wanted to mention why we placed a low score on that question. And by the way, the person who joined us from Tamarack for that visit, he did a wonderful job showing us around and explaining what we were seeing, he made sure we enjoyed our visit.

I hope these comments help on improving the experience for other first time buyers, small things that can make a huge difference."
TAM0716108,The samples were small. There should be a computer programme that allows you to see your selection in a virtual environment.
TAM12191009,"Nothing comes to mind in terms of suggestions for improvement. The initial list of upgrade options was appreciated and necessary for (pre) planning purposes, but the way in which it is formatted is somewhat confusing until the first design centre meeting."
TAM1015139,"Nothing at all, everything went smoothly."
TAM02182015,"I do not like the sales after I signed the contract. When I talk to them, it seems like I am idiotically. Anyway, it is very difficult to communicate with them."
TAM0915107,Noella was absolutely fantastic
TAM1215126,I would reduce the rate of the house.
TAM0213112,"Appliances to include with the house; OR increased design centre bonus to get appliances.

Great selection of standard options and availability.
Design centre experience was great.
Sales centre rep was very experienced and assisted with the purchase."
TAM0613113,"I really enjoyed going through the entire sales and design centre process, and definitely look forward to another Tamarack home!

The only thing that I'd like changed would be the addition of a timeline chart of the entire process (signing of initial agreement to closing day (and beyond). I understand that the ""Playbook"" outlines all these steps, but a chart would have been helpful for a visual learner like myself.

Thanks Tamarack!"
TAM0717106,Nothing
TAM1110110,"Unfortunately I was out of town due to death in the family when the sales office contacted me for the construction visit. I would had liked to do the inspection myself but was told that they couldn't wait the 3 days I was still going to be absent so the representative did it for me and assured me that everything noted on the contract had been verified and or modified. When returning to town a few days later, I was allowed to visit the interior of my house but the insulation and gypboard were already completed therefore could not verify certain options such as the reinforments for certain lights and placements of studs where I had a plug and conduit added in the kitchen for hanging a television. I did notice a few things that still have to be checked out such as the electrical boxes for the bathroom lights to be added and capped and telephone/cable outlet to be verified if there are going to be 2 of them in a certain room of if they forgot to add the 2nd outlet. Under these circumstances, it would had been nice to put off the visit a few days but understand the essence of time. I greatly appreciated the extra time and effort it took the sales representative to verify things for me and taking the time to call me to reassure me about this major step."
TAM0812139,Nothing. Debbie @ Sales & Kim @ Design Center were absolutely amazing. So was the whole Tamarack home buying process.
TAM1111122,I had some difficulty about being told 'yes we can' and signing to purchase...but only later to find out 'no we cant'
TAM07181025,"Sales: have the colour scheme boards available with accurate numbers before assigning to new buildings.  INCLUDE door colour on the boards.  We feel the door colour is not reflective of professional designers and makes a tasteful building look tacky and cheap. 

Design Centre: Ensure accuracy of the selections and they are recorded correctly.  Focus more on customer service.  We felt valued as customers at the sales centre but not so much at the design centre.  Want to highlight we did receive excellent customer service from Eliza and she should be recognised for this!"
TAM1210104,"We would like to have more time with our design consultant. We realize that we were free to browse on own our time; however, our design consultant was so much more knowledgeable about your selection and what worked best together than we were. It would have been wonderful to have more time to use her expertise."
TAM11171012,Make the staff be more pleasant.  The sales person.
TAM0816127,"Design Centre Process - we need more time! It's a bit overwhelming to make all of the selections in 3 meetings, especially when the initial one is more of a guided tour of the design centre.

Otherwise, loved the choices and available support!"
TAM05181010,Friendly and professional service.  Highly recommended!
TAM09181025,"Some things that I liked about Tamarack were also those that I disliked for different reasons. 

For example, the design process is very streamlined and quick. On the other hand, having such a strict approach to these appointments (offering 3 appointments), likely helps Tamarack to stay on track with their closing dates and avoids other hassles.   Thankfully we had a good idea of what we were looking for and prepared a lot outside of the three appointments. . If I could change something I think it would be that design appointments have some flex, depending on the amount of upgrades being done to the home. 

One other change I would consider making is a bit more ease to reach a design rep/centre via telephone. Some conversations are much easily expressed via phone as opposed to email but it seemed that phone lines were not answered.  If we left a message, this would be returned via email. 


All in all, we're very happy with the end result of our design choices and hope that these translate properly to the house."
TAM0815108,open on fridays
TAM10171035,Have an office on the west side of Ottawa to do upgrades and not have son May meetings
TAM0713109,"Nothing to this point.

Note:  Bought a house already built.  No selection or construction walk through."
TAM12171001,"A better way to check and ensure that all selections made at the design centre were correct. The purchaser having more details and matching of item numbers with the sign-off sheet.  Our only issue with this entire process were the interior doors that my family, all of three of us, feel are the wrong doors that have been installed in our home.   The people who work for Tamarack are all amazing people, the most helpful and truly lovely people to deal with.  We received several calls to deal with the situation but at this time, we have family issue back home six hours away and can't deal with this now.  We don't want to fight with anyone."
TAM10191054,N/A
TAM0515106,They did not give us enough options for the colors of the house. I did not know I had to pay extra if I chose a different color in a room.   The sales lady did not tell me about extra cost only after I signed and paid.
TAM0611119,"Sales process was unorganized when it came time for the lot release, I was one of many who slept outside experienced the chaos on the release date...   One or two more appointments with the designer would have been beneficial.  The length of time to complete the design process was too short and the time to receive pricing was too long.  I also wish Tamarack would consider some exceptions past the cut off time. Also, this day and age people mount their TV's above the firecplace, I was surprised during the frame walk through thatTamarack doesn't account for this with the addition of a few extra 2x4's for wall mounts, this should be standard, I am still waiting to find out if this was added to our home after notifying our sales rep.  All in all the experience was good, we look forward to moving in to our new home !"
TAM0610123,"The only thing I can recommend is to have better communication and knowledge between sale, design center and Contractor. Just to make it easier when there are questions that there are better knowledge as oppose to sending you somewhere else for an answer"
TAM03182004,interactive App that would show you how everything is going to look.
TAM0809103,"Very well organized, thoughtful and warm welcoming."
TAM0414117,Perhaps a little more time to choose
TAM0610144,"There is nothing wrong with the current process. If have to come up with new ideas, we would like to see a writing schedule for each steps after contract being signed. The schedule will tell us when we need to arrange the mortgage, each steps of working in design center, frame check etc..  That schedule will make whole process more transparent.  But the current process is working well."
TAM1111146,That the workers are notified about what should and should not be removed according to the purchase and sales agreement of the buyer.  Lanscaping/shrubs and patio stones were removed at the front of my house that should have remained as per my sales agreement.  It was replaced with grass that I am not happy with.
TAM0610100,"1) Appointment Process: I do agree that 45 days are guidelines but it could be respected by providing second appointment within 30 days not after 40 days that what happen in my case, which would delay my closing date.
and that has cost you little extra on your interest payment.
2) Site Supervisor supposed to check the work of contractor against the design drawing.In my case, Contractor has installed the Fireplace according to sales drawing, which has resulted in rework of many people.

Thanks for considering my opinion."
TAM1015105,Air conditioning I got caught at last minute during the frame check.  The design centre didn't tell us if we didn't take air conditioning right then that they would have to tear down one of the ceilings.  I had 48 hours to get the approval for air conditioning.  I had to pay out of pocket rather than put it on the mortgage.  It was a hassle.  In the upgrades I had to really check the billing on it due to many errors.  If I hadn't owned a home before my daughter would have been very overwhelmed.  I wasn't impressed with the design centre.  She was nice but she should know her job.  The sales people were good though
TAM08181023,Design center we felt we were rushed. It seemed when the our appointment time was up we were rushed.
TAM0909123,A computer program to show how the colors and designs chosen look all put together and access to it from home before the meeting.
TAM1111115,"I would not be so greedy in the markup applied at the design centre.

From crazy lot premiums, ceramic baseboards priced illogically (and when they responded their response had holes in t it and did not even have the courtesy to reply to my email pointing out their mis-calculation), to $240 for a shower light - home depot less than $100 - and it doesn't even include a switch, to Moen curtain rods marked up about 500%, etc....

I realize Tamarack is a track builder and they can do this b/c they 'can' and people will pay for it... they still need to realize that nobody forgets being gouged and they are already being paid quite well for the home itself.

Like I said... be LESS greedy and YOU will SELL MORE homes and the people who buy them from you will be much happier in the process and will make more referrals... otherwise its a short term vision and people will eventually get tired of being raked and will go elsewhere..."
TAM0415103,Be able to visit our unit once every week or two. To see how things are moving along.
TAM1213112,I was not impressed with the way they installed the brick from outside there is a lots of cracks and dents!!
TAM08181003,The hours at the sale centre should start earlier. Base options are inadequate. When I asked about the taxes on the upgrades I could not get a straight answer! Some of the upgrade prices were ridiculous. I wanted to upgrade to laminate in the basement since my husband has asthma and the price that was given was outrageous. And no credit was being given back for the carpet. It would be nice to be able to have an approximate final price of your house prior to purchasing it. I found that a lot of things “needed” to be upgraded and we ended up going over our budget.
TAM0913100,"There's not really anything that we would change, everyone was nice and everything went well.
But it was always really hard to schedule an apointment.
Apart from that everything was great."
TAM1013120,NA
TAM0211102,"I would have appreciated the initial options that were available over and above elevation, lot, brick color etc. such as door styles etc. to be offered similiar to how options are presented at the design center."
TAM06161005,Make the option catalogue more clear with regards to kitchen cabinets.  It was very misleading.  Other than that our experience was amazing. Mandy Mason at the design centre and Noella Francoeur of the sales centre were excellent and very impressive with their knowledge and customer service.
TAM1014111,"I had to deal with a few frustrations related to the design process.  I found that there were not enough choices for countertops with the colours I was choosing with cabinets, flooring, etc.  Nothing matched, and I ended up choosing things I will probably replace.  It would have been nice to be able to go to a company for more options, like we could for ceramic for example.

Also, after choosing my hardwood, I was told later that I could not have it anymore because the hardwood company had been changed for my house.  This ended up being very frustrating and ended up costing me more than 1000$ extra which was not planned because I could not find anything that matched my cabinets and other selections with the new floorings available with the new company.  I had to upgrade to get something similar to what I had originally chosen with the initial hardwoods.  

Other than that, things have been good so far.  I look forward to seeing the final product."
TAM05181013,I was not being updated sooner about my house closing date. To this date I still have not received any response regarding this issue so I don’t know when the house can be closed and when I expect to have a frame walkthrough. Maybe it is better that someone can explain it to me.
TAM0514104,Notification of items that are going to be discontinued
TAM1110133,"1) Clients should be better aware that structural changes cannot be made once the city has approved the plans.Clients should be more aware of what constitutes a structural change.

EXAMPLE :It was at this stage that we decided to have hardwood added to the stair step treads and have the risers and stringer painted white. 

We were told that this was a structural change because we were now changing the height of the riser. 

Even though the contractor had yet to start making the stairs we were told that this could not be done.Now we are stuck with something that will cost us about $8000.00 to change after construction. 

2) Roof vents should be upgraded by builder and standard in all homes. The plastic mushroom caps are poor quality and look low grade on these homes. Even Mattamy is using the better flute type vents.This comment has been made by several new owners that we have met .

Regards 
Mark"
TAM0612113,"It is our second time building a new house, and overall we are satisfied, but the biggest take-away from our experience with Tamarack is that there isn't much flexibility.

- Having more flexibility when it comes to options such as lighting and handles would have been appreciated.  It would be nice if we could have chosen our own handles/lights and have had the builder install them. 

- Prices for upgrades are very expensive (i.e. garage door opener, under-cabinet lighting, etc.) and greatly discouraged us from choosing them.  Had the prices been reasonable, we likely would have purchased these items from you instead of from a third party.

- Having more flexibility when it comes to the closing date would have been nice.  When the house is built and waiting for the interior design, +/- a couple of days should not be the end of the world when the closing date is three months away. (Our last builder did all the interior in three weeks!)

- Throughout the buying process, Tera was amazing, very helpful, and always available.  She gave us a lot of ideas, information, personal experience which helped us in our decisions.

- The staff in general was knowledgeable and nice."
TAM0812125,"""It would have been useful to have had more time with the design consultant.

Also, our home has been sitting at a much advanced phase of construction than the home next to us however, they have an earlier closing date.  We were under the impression that changing our closing date should not be a problem but were later told that you 'do not change closing dates'.  As a result of our military relocation, we will be homeless (seemingly unnecessarily) for 6 weeks.  We are likely moving back to Kingston next summer but will likely reconsider buying building through Tamarack because of the lack of consideration and absence of a reasonable explanation."""
TAM07191045,"There are a few things I want to comment.

(1) During the sale process in June 2018, one of the bonus your salesperson highlighted was a 6-month free Internet + TV package which is worth around $1000. This was printed black and white in my contract. However, now July 2019, I found out Cogeco no longer has this deal. In between, I was not informed about this change by Tamarack Homes. Anyway, I think this promotion is very misleading, which led to my disappointment.

(2) During the sale process, there was no mention that Tamarack Homes won't install eavestroughs. It's also not an option for a upgrade. I mean I put my trust in a professional builder like Tamarack, at least let me know in advance. I found out about the missing eavestroughs during a raining day when I visited the site and I saw large amount of water dripping from the roof right above my garage door. This is another not-so-pleasant surprise. As a buyer, I want transparency. Salespersons should not just focus on what the builder will build, but also what the builder won't build. 

(3) There are a few things lost during the communications, such as a missing laundry tub in the basement, a wrong sink was removed in a bathroom. These errors were quickly corrected. I just thought if there were better communications between your sales persons and site stuff, a lot of errors could be avoided. In turn, it will make both your staff and my whole home purchasing experience less stressful. Anyway, I want to say there is room for improvement.     

(4) Finally, the design of this survey. The term ""Frame Check Walk-Through"" is being used in the survey. What I had was a ""Mechanical  Walk-Through"". I figured out the two terms are probably refer to the same activity. However, it can cause some confusions to non-professionals like myself."
TAM1016120,"More sales representatives available to help at design centre.
New standard choices that are more ""up to date""
New design centre location as the building is falling apart and was leaking on us during our visits.
On time construction.
Easier process to make upgrades (not having to go back and forth to vendors).
Design centre hours - open later at night."
TAM0511100,"More visual selections, especially for the Kitchen. Perhaps a photo album.  Show the stain samples on all the wood choices, i.e. show chocolate stain on maple, oak, cherry etc.
Perhaps have a person dedicated to only the kitchen process, with auto cad etc.
When we came in for our interiors we were booked for only one hour and we were expected to select the kitchen too, our manual said that we should get three hours?
Overall we felt very rushed.  It's a very big ticket purchase, so we expected a higher level of customer service, and we noticed as the moved farther along in the process, custom service dewindled"
TAM0514108,I don't think I would change anything.
TAM0713113,"Yes, there is a false sense of value for quotations received through the design centre. Clearly Tamarack is overcharging for even the simplest upgrade. Phone call to the President (Chris) was not even returned when he personally said he would be responsive to his clients. Very disappointed in the design center as a whole. Always changes appointments and making it difficult to see a representative during the evening. We did find Muskoka to be exceptional in contrast. With this design centre experience we would not recommend Tamarack to anyone who wishes to do any upgrades or spend good money on overpriced upgrades. Better to either not buy Tamarack or line up a bunch of contractors to do the jobs after you move in. This message should be a wake up call to the executive."
TAM04191016,Design center should have someone on the weekend to help it out if needed
TAM0612133,"sales, design and construction should be connect each other more tighly so that we could reach any of them to address any issues related to structure, design or contruction."
TAM0110120,"More time to review choices made at the Design Centre stage. We always felt rushed at every meeting we had. We were forced to make deicisions very quickly and in a hurry.
Better information on how to deal with the different suppliers for upgrades. 
Starting this process earlier to avoid delay in construction. Our construction was on hold for 2 months whille completing this process."
TAM10191016,"Valarie, Darlene everyone got it, all good."
TAM0714109,"The process of waiting for quotes from the supplier tended to take a while and we felt a little rushed with our final decisions based on the delay of these responses.  While we understand that it is difficult to get a price list with all potential upgrades, it may have helped expedite the process.  As a result, having a list of price ranges (with available choices within those ranges) would have been beneficial.  Overall, however, the experience was terrific!"
TAM0414114,"Reasonable changes should be allowed at different stages, ie, once structural  is signed off on, there is absolutely no way to revisit it- even very early in the process. They could also use a better system for tracking changes and updates so it isn't confusing to the buyer. I felt like I had to constantly go back to emails to make sure nothing was missed. Additional options added to kitchen plan as potential upgrades appears deceptive. We were told we would be able to inspect the wiring and framing at the frame check, but it was all drywalled up and we couldn't inspect anything inside the walls. We did have an issue with something being in the wrong place. Cable was supposed to be up on the wall but it was down on the floor. We have an outlet where it was supposed to be, but the cable wasn't. We asked about it and how we could handle it, but we haven't had any response from two messages, and when I tracked someone down they agreed that they remember our conversation and said they would get back to me. Our granite was supposed to be inspected, but it never was. We have 6 contacts and they chose to only call our home number while we weren't home, so they went ahead and cut the granite without our inspection. We were concerned about it as it's a big expense and we didn't get a chance to take a look. This is our third house we've built, and of the three this is our most expensive house, and we are the least satisfied with it."
TAM0613119,Kingston Woodhaven - the design centre does not have good lighting in the room with the samples so if the room is not flooded with sunlight it is challenging to view some samples to appreciate the colours and how they match with other samples.
TAM10191039,"Nothing to change, 
The team is great"
TAM0317102,"We were shocked that in 2016, the sales/design/upgrade process still relied on mountains of paperwork and selecting options through a catalogue. It was a confusing and frustrating experience. I would recommend investing in software. In this day and age, a buyer should be able to visually see a potential home and select/view any proposed options through 3D renderings on a computer. It's amazing the process hasn't changed!"
TAM0717108,"Both processes were great, but we found there was sometimes a lack of consistent messaging regarding timelines depending on who we spoke to. Our sales rep would indicate one timeline, which would be contradicted by our design centre consultant."
TAM0714103,"As per completed questionnaire: Nothing: You have excellent team very knowlegable, curtious best company known by the people its keep. For us best builder in town.
Kept 10 years got good price Tamarack offord model(708 Blue Vale LN Riversid South excellent home design by Berry Hobbins. 2nd time buyer, 3rd one we are working on it."
TAM11191011,"the time taken between purchasing and occupancy was long, particularly for someone who wants to occupy quickly."
TAM0815127,"We bought a charleston model and love it, just wish the furnace etc were set up different to create room for even a small spare bedroom"
TAM0113112,enlarge the garage to 20*20 from 18*20
TAM0816131,So far this has been a great experience. We have not built before but from what I have heard and witnessed through friends Tamarack is a premier builder.
TAM1112109,"He saw his floor plan on paper but, there was no model home to walkthrough of the one he purchased.  He doesn't like the layout now that he is in it.  He would recommend having a model home for each type of home."
TAM04191021,I would add more to the standard options you have! It is so limited and not in style! You get surprises with the amount of money you spend on upgrades!
TAM0812126,"Design Center - An online selection of samples you can view before visits, and later hours on weeknights. More pricing info for self serve, may save time with the consultant onsite, as one could evaluate options and compare costs."
TAM12191005,"The choosing went well but when it came to finalizing, we had questions and in order to get an answer we had to contact the supervisor and we were concerned  that we would not be signing in time"
TAM0313108,"I wish I had more time to make decisions, looking back I already know something’s I would like to change which is frustrating.  I felt rushed.  I am not a very visual person, so I found it really hard to “see” what my choices will look like.  I will admit that I am nervous I will not like my selections."
TAM0912121,"""All structural options should be offered and explained with a reminder of the dates following which changes cannot be made even though this is in the purchase and sale agreement. All changes to model homes (upgrades) should be noted specifically for each model in lieu of the general info sheets available in each home. More time should be allocated to the structural change deadline. 
Design centre experience is great but could use more time with the designer prior to finalizing choices. 
Still a superior product with excellent personnel in place to address any and all concerns. Very impressed with how personal it is despite the number of builds. Don't lose that!"""
TAM1016125,"Design Centre Process - very rushed, felt like I was being a burden when I asked questions, not very good at giving suggestions, felt that design centre rep was just trying to get through process as fast as possible,in fact seamed frustrated at some points"
TAM0611130,No issues with the design centre process other than an issue with the person we originally met with at Muskoka for the kithcen design.  This issue was communicated to Tamarack and quickly resolved.
TAM0514102,Absolutely nothing!!! Deborah and Chrustine wee just amazing to work with!!
TAM05181006,"Tamarack should not charge for minor changes and requests, grout colour changes, asking for additional plug points, reinforcement for a ceiling fan, a few extra pot lights. We also wanted to change the orientation for the garage to get more light right at the beginning and even though it could be done at that time, it was not considered. We felt that we were nickle and dimed for small things.
On a positive note, the staff and sales people and workers have been very friendly and helpful and willing to listen and answer our questions always. we always feel welcome in your Findlay Creek sales centre and the staff there is very cheerful, friendly and helpful."
TAM0112104,Nothing at all.
TAM1113105,Nothing!
TAM0611129,"ABOUT THE DESIGN CENTRE - TO GET THE PRICING ON TIME SO THAT WE COULD MAKE THE SELECTIONS PROPERLY. AND ALSO TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE COUPLE OF THINGS AFTER SIGNING THE DOCUMENTS AS THERE MIGHT BE SOME LAST MINUTE CHANGES WE ALL AS BUYERS WOULD LIKE TO DO AS 'HOMES ' ARE BIG AND FOR MOST OF US ONE TIME INVESTMENT (AND NOT LIKE CARS, OR OTHER COMMODITIES ) ."
TAM1014123,"Don't nickel and dime over simple chages ie: hosebib location, it's already there, house hasn't been built yet, why charge to move it??"
TAM0614115,"Design: they were pretty good, maybe not having a distinction (hardwood flooring, different selections of wood for diff. developers) found that strange."
TAM04182021,"They should respond to customers when they try to contact them. I went to the office five times, I called and emailed multiple times and no one answered. Also, they delayed the closing by one month and ten days. The Sales Director emailed me saying that I had not completed the design selections. This was not true, I had completed everything but I was just waiting for the papers from Tamarack so I could sign them. My wife is pregnant and now her due date is the same as the new closing date. Now I have a new baby coming and I have to move on the same day."
TAM12191012,Design centre is about making choices on different colors and different materials for the home.    If they had pictures of how things look together not only samples what it will look like putting all those samples together the customer would benefit from this getting the whole picture.
TAM0710129,I would not change a thing my experience so far as been very positive.
TAM0614214,More clarity in upgrade costs leading up to the design centre process.
TAM0510100,Design Centre very disorganized and extreme lack of attention to detail!  Poor communication (with exception of Chantal and Sheri!) follow-up very poor.
TAM0517113,"Jacqui was very knowledgeable and took care of MOST questions. She was great until we signed the contract and then it seemed that her portion was completed and we were now in the process.... She has taken questions and emails from us since then but she has the notion that Tamarack has been VERY accommodating in rectifying problems when the customer service has definitely been lacking. We have had small issues and concerns that arose, which WE had to notice, and we ere often pointed to the next person to have to deal with  (never really smooth process). Carolyn at the design process was often not easily reached, not knowledgeable about cost and upgrades, made us feel silly for asking questions where we required assistance. There was an issues with what is available for viewing in the model home (which sold us on the specific house) and apparently was changed over the years. None of this was explained to us and were going to be charged to make OUR design like the model home. Eventually worked out but with us arguing and catching a lot of the issues ourselves. On to the walk through...I only contacted Pierre when I was told too, and he was often very unpleasant and unaccommodating. When I asked for some possible accommodations he was very cold and blunt regarding problems we had with the 9-2pm 'office hours' and his response of that's Tamaracks rules. We understand the rules that are set but the communication to a customer was poor customer service. Overall, I think Tamarack houses are incredible in terms of quality (but we are paying for it), but the building process, I do not recommend to friends. We were told from others some members (facets) of the Kingston staff were difficult to deal with, but wanted to build our own home. We were told it would be fun and exciting. We are excited to see the finished product but due to our own attentiveness to detail and questioning things as first time builders, have caught a lot of simple errors and mistakes. We feel that this is not 'our' job to have to catch these errors and that makes us not overall pleased or comfortable with this whole process. I find this all amazing because we are definitely not picky people and could not imagine how someone would react if they were dealing with some of the customer service issues we have had. I am sorry for laying this all out in a 'survey' but feel like it needed to be said. Again, we are very excited to get our finished home and know that Tamarack has an excellent reputation for their builds, however, we just wish this 'building' process didn't sour some of the experience. Thanks for reading and have a great day."
TAM1016116,Include a graphic design of the house after you choose the upgrades to make the experience better and give better prospective of how the house will look.
TAM08181054,I would have the design catalogue be representative of the upgrade options that are available in a particular model. Our catalogue listed several upgrades that we wanted that were apparently not available to us. Also there was a disconnect between sales and the design centre on when some upgrades had to be selected (tiled shower base) and in the end we were not able to get the particular upgrade. We were also given misinformation on one of our upgrades which caused a delay in the design process and significant frustration on our end.
TAM1209118,"Say what you do and do what you say. If the company really care about the quality and its customers' opinions, the best way is to visit the people who are living in the houses built by Tamarack. This kind of feedback may just be an red tape and will not make any difference to what the company is doing and will be doing."
TAM0915101,"A follow up of the changes/remarks made during the framing walk through.
Have the lists of upgrades at the time of sale as it could impact budget/model selection."
TAM0815105,"Nothing really, all were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful."
TAM0516107,Give us more time to think about design center upgrades and get more info
TAM06172005,Everyone I met was professional and genuinely helpful.  I like that the Tamarack build is smaller/more community focused over other new developments.  I really enjoy nature trails and like that there is also going to be public access to the creek with pathways as part of a larger community building vision.
TAM0710128,At the sales office we were not told about what changes could be made to the plans. We were never told that the basement bathroom could be moved.
TAM0914110,"We don't remember providing expressed permission to provide our contact information to CustomerInsight in order to survey us regarding our experience. In the future, expressed permission to share our contact information should be requested and permission granted. 

There were a few instances during structural and design phases, when dealing with multiple Tamarack representatives led to confusion and delays regarding our specifications and changes. All Tamarack reps certainly did their best to help, but really what was needed was a consistent rep who knew our needs well and/or to speak directly to those responsible for making the decision. For instance, there was quite a bit of confusion regarding structural changes to our basement, exterior colour selection and the selection of our hardwood."
TAM0710123,"Make sure the sales and design offices talk to each in coordinating schedules. For example our closing date was moved up twice because the design centre did not have any suiteable dates in their calendar for final selections. This is totally unsatisfactory. Also, the sales office gave misleading information with regards to structural changes (e.g. basement rough-in) and told us that would be done at design centre... which was incorrect.  Clearly Tamarach had an excellent sales year and I hope that they increase their capacity along with the demand. I certainly hope that the after sales service and build quality do not suffer due to the increased demand."
TAM08191023,nothing
TAM1118118,Flexibility regarding exterior choices
TAM1109119,"We have noticed a problem in communication between Head Office, Sales Office and Design Center.  We found out for example, that the drywall had been finished in our home before we had even made our selections even though the official go-ahead had not been given either by the Design Center or the Sales Office.  Serge took a quick tour through the house during construction and noticed this and that several other things had not been completed properly (no fireplace installed in basement, ceiling not prepared for pot lights, no additional outlets had been installed as requested.  We are a bit concerned that our home will not be properly finished or that it will be done in a manner which is unsightly.  

I also would like to comment that the mark-up for services and products is extremely high, forcing us to choose lower quality products when we could easily purchase the better ones if it were not for the ridiculous profit margin you impose."
TAM10171036,Give more time to review documentation. Allow for time to get pre-approval for a mortgage.
TAM0615129,"more flexibility for closing date,for those who has to sell their present home"
TAM09171013,"There were missed communications on available upgrade options,  mainly for structural upgrades.  Freestanding bathtub, exterior stone, kitchen bulkhead was to follow the upper cabinets, fireplace upgrade (upgraded size was communicated - however not the fact that the model had it raised above the ground).  At the framing inspection we noticed the kitchen bulkhead was not as we had requested nor was the fireplace.  Luckily we were advised the bulkhead would be corrected but unfortunately, the fireplace could not be raised above the ground like the model - it was too far along in the construction.  We are disappointed about the fireplace. Therefore, my recommendation would be to ensure sales office and design centre communicate all possible upgrades at the appropriate time, allowing buyers enough time to consider them.  Otherwise, the sales, design and construction staff have all been fantastic, knowledgeable, professional and courteous. Our experience so far has been very good.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments."
TAM01201002,N/A
TAM0717117,"Better organization of samples - tiles and backslash in particular. Chose all from subs, not at design center location."
TAM0411121,"Up to this point, where we've just gone thru the sales and design stages; we were a little bit dissapointed with the fact that Tamarack has become reluctant to give us the opportunity to change the stairs (originally we wanted in wood and not in carpet) The explanation was that due to the fact that the house was a quick occupancy one, that decision was made in advance. Still don't understand why not approve the change if we were willing to pay for it. And quite honestly that change don't think would take that much of a toll in terms of timing to deliver the end product. Our point here is that there should be a little bit more flexibility on those situations. We understand the negative in the case of a structural change of the original plans, if that involves the need of government approval and has legal implications. Don't think the stairs change we were asking could be considered in that category. Another change that we would suggest is that a few items that we wanted to add to the house (regarding the fire place and bathrooms), the Design Center provided us the contacts to do the inquired on our behalf, but the quoting would only be provided to Tamarack and not us... Why is that? I do the call and the third party contacts the builder... I understand the commercial implications of that. Then, shouldn't be more logical that Tamarack takes ownership of that piece, too? You get the specs from the customer and you ask for the quoting. At the end, everything comes down to a budgeted list of yes or no choice... Just an idea."
TAM0716118,"I felt that I was nickel and dime'd on many items. This is not a cheap home and at times I felt as though I was trying to have a quick buck made on me at each turn. I'm a sales manager of a local dealership and enjoy the sales process. I run things very differently then the tamarack group evidently. There was a discrepancie over a range hood fan, conduit, and my design centre bonus ( I was under the impression this was a pre tax discount, opposed to after tax, most people would refer to that as a ""rebate"" not a ""discount""). All in all this was a first time home buying experience for us and I'll reiterate this is in no way a starter home, and my experience thus far has me concerned over how warranty items will be addressed in the future.

At this point I would defiantly not recommend friends and family

Ryan Martin"
TAM1012101,"Sales centre should have discussed upgrades before signing the purchase agreement. We were a little taken aback by the prices of upgrades. 

Didn't appreciate that some of my questions were answered with ""because"" at the design centre. I am not a child, I am paying for the house, I deserve an answer as to why you don't colour match paint and why I can't put wall tiles around my fireplace."
TAM07181019,NO
TAM06191022,nothing
TAM0111105,Did not have enough time at the design centre. Need more time between scheduled appointments to make choices.
TAM06181026,The Design centre should have 3D design software in order to show clients how their selections will look. Design centre staff should also be more knowledgeable with regards to pricing. More standard selections would be appreciated.
TAM0313101,"Nothing, it was perfect."
TAM0712138,It was sufficent.
TAM0711116,"Better communication between the builder and some of the contractors.  The plans that were sent to the kitchen contractors did not match the house.  We ended up with an extra bulk head that was not in the blue prints or plans.  Our kitchen was then upgraded with that plan, and as such, we are having the stress of going through the kitchen re-design and plans after already signing off on them"
TAM0614119,Have more fixed prices available.
TAM0916107,"1.  Greater flexibility in booking design centre appointments.  Due to consultants being constantly booked,  we had significant difficulty fitting appointments into our own work schedules.

2.  Change design centre hours.  More evening and weekend hours would be appreciated, especially for those of us who tend to work extended hours from Monday-Friday (and those who live outside of the City of Ottawa).

3.  Sales centre was excellent!  Perhaps easier access to the unfinished house.

4.  Online selection platform for interior design options (colours, materials, appliances, etc.).  A virtual design centre where you could build and view a digital version of your house would  help move the entire progress along more efficiently, 

5.  More detailed explanation from design centre on the overall process for first time home buyers (it often felt like information overload with the size of the selection package presented with limited time to make final choices, book appointments with multiple stores, etc.)."
TAM11191023,"Sales process was great, but I would change the design centre so that standard options are more obviously defined/organized."
TAM1111107,Design centre consultant should allow purchaser more time to decide on available choices i.e. in their presence!
TAM0912122,"The model home is false represenation. 
They are done up to the nines.
Were not aware that many of the items were upgrades as opposed to standard."
TAM1016104,"Sales:  Transparency and honesty concerning the construction schedule is essential.  We lined up for three days ahead of lot release to get the lot of our choice and were assured at that time of being first on the street for construction start and closing.  An early September closing was critically important to us to maximize sale value of our current home and allow a door to door move.  We were assured as recently as mid February that everything was on track for a 7 March construction start.  Yet on 11 April, we were informed that due to a delay in getting building permits, closing would be delayed until Oct 7.  I suspect Tamarack was aware of this delay several months earlier but did not tell us until after all the paperwork for the sale had been finalized.  This delay ended up costing us $20,000 in the sale of our home (owing to the need to remain in our home into October).  

Upgrade Pricing.  
 1.  Several items we requested that were standard upgrades in the catalogue, especially plumbing fixtures, a corner bathtub, a shower niche, ceramic wall tile for the shower were ridiculously poverpriced.  The most outrageous of these was quoting $910 for a shower niche Mondeau had quoted at $635, and a further $400 for installation.  We have recent experience with bathroom renovations and know this pricing is completely unreasonable.  At any rate, we challenged several of the quotes and in some cases, prices were reduced substantially.  In other cases, we simply opted to do without.  Both Sales and Design Centre staff, who were all a pleasure to work with, were quite open about the fact that Tamarack margins on many categories of upgrades are very high.  Many aspects of the buying experience were very positive, but Tamarack's reputation when it comes to upgrade pricing is seriously tarnished in our view, and, unfortunately, we will share that view when asked about Tamarack.  Customers want value for money spent, and we certainly don't feel we got that in the upgrade process. 
 2.  Also please consider reviewing price credits for standard items replaced by upgrades, or at least be prepared to give a more detailed costing on upgrades. Best example of this was replacing the tiled Roman tub in the ensuite with an untiled corner tub and being charged what appears to be full price for the new tub with no credit for what Tamarack would not be installing.  Bottom line on this is you could do much more to assuage customers by providing a detailed cost quote for non-standard upgrades, including what credit is being given for the stanadard item not provided.  

The Customer Care experience has thus far been less than satisfying.  Email requests have gone unanswered in spite of asking for acknowledgment, and in at least two cases where we have spoken by phone we have found the representatives to be surprisingly cavalier (to the point of being rude), unsympathetic to our concerns, and sometimes less than helpful.  Perhaps they just have too many customers on their plates.  I don't know.  But this has been the most disappointing aspect of the buying experience by far.  

With all of that said, Noella Francoeur at the Cardinal Creek Sales office and Kim Knuth at the Design Centre have been a real pleasure to work with - caring, knowledgeable and extremely helpful in all respects.  True professionals and nice people.   We are very excited about the progress on our home and are looking forward to closing soon!"
TAM0910125,"The whole process from stat to finish with our purchase and with dealing with Daryle on site cannot be faulted.  This has been a very happy experience.  I would only ask for more information about the final colour selection for the exterior that the architect has chosen.  This is not an important factor as there's no choice for the purchaser but it's nice to know in advance what they will be.
Keep up the good work."
TAM0713107,I think the upgrades are way over priced. I would have also like to have used another Audio/Video company to run the wiring in the home.
TAM0317100,"The design centre I would have more standard options for toilets and faucets.  Everything else had a good selection.  When it comes to plumbing and lighting fixtures, it is limited."
TAM1112108,Lower the cost of upgrades.
TAM0812107,No Comments
TAM0717110,"Instead of charging $500 for drywall fees and to save time, let the buyers decide before drywall where outlets and caps should go.  Also, for shower as well.  Instead of automatically assuming the person wants an standard shower surround, ask them if they want tiling first before you have to let them know you have to pay $500 to drywall and remove the surround when it's not needed. Found it very untrustworthy"
TAM08191007,"Pricing of some upgrades is astronomical when compared to purchasing from current market ie flooring, hoodfans, bathroom/kitchen fixtures, baseboards & crown moldings. Others are very much aligned with current values and have a modest to reasonable markup incorporated."
TAM1013116,"There were some challenges to meet when I was living out of town and the deadlines were ""rushed"".  At the same time the irony was my closing date was delayed by 18 days... which is not only a gross inconvenience (as I chose the place because of the closing date) but also a financial burden as well since the bank does not budge after the 90 day guaranteed mortgage rate is passed!  So this has been a MAJOR downside to this process!"
TAM0711129,"nothing. it was absolutely perfect. never had better service in our life.
they truly care and are passionate and will refer them to everyone.
thank you for a great experience.

Emily and Joe Iaderosa"
TAM0214108,"The design centre was a nightmare. We ended up with few upgrades because of the options, and have many upgrades to do once we get the home - including 2 of our ""must haves"" we are told ""no"". If we had known, we would've bought with someone else."
TAM0411126,"what is represented in model homes is NOT your standard, we spent 25% more than your standard price."
TAM0112103,"Sales process- I wanted to remove bathtub and was told I couldnt, I tried various options and all were rejected.  But then I find out I could have changed the tub through the upgrade process and no one mentioned that.  Also there was another option for the same model which would have actually provided a better choice to enable changing the tub to a shower, but no one suggested it! 

As for the design centre-answer questions in a timely manner.  Have a catalogue that is complete ie prices included and up to date.  THere are alot of options no one really knows about. ALso perhaps a relationship with a lighting supplier, and appliance supplier, would be helpful."
TAM1015112,Flexible work hours to accommodate full time working customers
TAM0113109,Nothing I can think of off the top of my head.
TAM07191033,"For sales:
Too much rush, I was not able to select the day and date of my choice for signing the document.
For design:
Our design experts have too much load, all together.
The design center can be more organized and the tiles can be displayed more to choose from, instead of in a box.
Overall, the people are nice and helping, and guide you well, but with limited time in hand."
TAM0211120,I did not enjoy dealing with Gayle from Muskoka kitchens for the design of my kitchen.  I would have rathered dealt with my design consultant from Tamarack instead.
TAM0809116,Overall I was extremely satisfied with the entire process.
TAM0809107,"To improve communication between new buyers and Tamarack Homes, by ensuring that lines of communications are open and information sharing flows to keep buyers informed on latest developments and the construction of their home."
TAM02182010,Everything is ok in design center but some of updates are very high.
TAM1010126,No comment
TAM1016128,Nothing...very pleased!
TAM1012118,"to have more appointments with the designer centre, and need to more visual  pictures on site to reflect the interior designs."
TAM11171013,"The first design centre appointment should be before signing the buying agreement, the design centre should explain the potential upgrade and rough costs per buyer's interests, and show buyer some most popular upgrade and costs and its added value to the new house, show buyer where to get the most information for the upgrade items.
Before the frame check, buyer should be trained for potential issue for the house so that they would not miss any important part.
The sale representatives should be very actively respond to buyer's issue or request with the new house  from beginning to the end of warranty period."
TAM0716110,"Right from the bottom up I have no use for them at all.  I could take a hammer and ram it through the house.  Not built well.  The building code is allowing to do this.  There is too much chip board and particle board in it.  The air conditioner is too small.  We have a 2 tonne here and the hot water system is not up to snuff.  We wanted to buy our own and put them in.  They come from China and the things aren't reliable.  We wanted to buy our own that are better built but the builder kept blocking us.  They don't offer any sort of warranty or paperwork for these.
We were told that we would have room for 2 cars and there isn't.  When we look around now and comparing prices I feel the house is $30,000 more than everywhere else."
TAM1113107,"Absolutely nothing; quite honestly, the process has been very clear from the start, your design centre's doors were wide open even prior to the scheduled appointments and your staff were fantastic (I visited the design centre 4-5 times before my ""official"" series of appointments and the staff was extremely helpful, taking the time to answer all my questions and let me browse freely...no pressure...loved it!!).
Valerie was very helpful in making up my mind and going through the contract and steps that followed!!
I also visited a couple of your projects to get design ideas and perspective on build quality...etc. and have been impressed by the consistency of the layouts/build/quality and friendliness of your representatives!

So far, it's been an amazing experience, positive and worry free; I couldn't have asked for more, especially that it's my first house!

PS. This survey request was totally unexpected and much appreciated...talk about accountability!! Brilliant :)

Thank you so much,
Sari"
TAM1213115,"When asked about approx. cost of upgrades in model homes, be honest and don't say it was half the cost of how much the upgrades would actually cost a client."
TAM0315100,Better and quicker communication  between the sale center and design center and client to avoid delays.
TAM1111130,It was all good and friendly and professionally handled.
TAM1109109,"At the design centre Tamarack failed to meet their timeline of 45 days to  complete design process due to understaffing. Consequently we were browbeaten into 'living' with our choices from the second meeting as we were told our house would be delayed indefinitely if we changed anything. We had assumed that we could do a slight adjustment at that last meeting. Upgrade specifications did not reach site office for over three weeks after our last meeting because again of understaffing therefore we still feel we could have made a minor change to our kitchen backsplash without delaying the construction of our house.

About the sales process, we feel that Tamarack uses a double standard when dealing with it clients. When asked about certain options for our home we were told they were not available however some people were given the opportunity to purchase said options while others were not. Also we were led to beleive that what you see in a model home can be purchased as an upgrade but later were told that some things are just decorating choices of the designer therefore we can look at them for inspiration only! When selecting our exterior package we inquired about stone and were told that there would be no stone used in Half Moon Bay now we find out that a significant number of people are indeed getting stone......also used on a model home. 

When contacting construction vice-president concerning changing an option (before excavating had even begun) we were told that construction timeline would be significantly delayed in other words we should have asked sooner. We had asked our sales rep many times before and her answer was always not possible until we found out that she did not have the last word on these matters and should have referred us to the construction vice-president in the first place.

The blue print meeting involved only the sales rep who was also involved with a couple buying a house at that time. Our blueprint does not represent the house we are purchasing, it is actually the reverse orientation and cluttered with options we did not purchase therefore it is rather difficult to show the exact positon of additionnal outlets, phone jacks, cable outlets and so on. Our freezer outlet is now sitting under the hotwater system so I guess we will have to hope that we can actually use it and not have to hire an electrician to put in a new one in a more convenient place."
TAM09181038,A more friendly lead sales representative
TAM06181017,"DESIGN CENTER BONUS WAS CHANGED. I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS.
THE COST OF UPGRADES TOO HIGH."
TAM0613100,We had found that there was a lot of inflexibility in choices and we had to go in three times to pick out tile as each tile that we chose was on back order.  Our first appointment was very rushed and we were really disappointed. Especially since we has met with the manager. We were pressured to make decisions very quickly.  We had a much better experience with our second designer.
TAM0910116,"Update sample product pictures
Reduce tile selection"
TAM09181046,"The every single one of your staff are simply amazing! From the very first email to our latest appointment we felt at ease with the process and how knowledgeable every person was that we talked to. No improvements required in that department they exceeded our expectations. 

The design centre was an amazing candy store of options. It was a bit overwhelming at first. As you have so many options, it would be nice to see all of the standard finishes together so that it is easy to see what they are.  It would be especially helpful in the tile area if they were organized by upgrade level. 

At the model homes we know you provide a great list of what is included as a standard and what is an upgraded feature as  visual people if something in the model home like the stickers you use in the design centre to help identify that what we were seeing was or wasn't included for some of the finishing touches we would have found that helpful. 

The experience we have been having overall is incredible we are so happy with our purchase of a Tamarack home."
TAM08172006,"The design center should give enough time between first and cabinet discussion and second appointment.  Design center better have one people follow one case. For example, we have to work with design center, cabinets company, electronic company. This brings much more work to us and difficult to collaborate. The pricing processing and redesign cabinets in design center is very slow. They do not prefer to give a second plan for redesign cabinets. No detail plan/picture in the final review appointment, easy to miss some items.
Recommend develop a software to play with for selection colour and style for each model. At least more showrooms at design center."
TAM1111138,"sometimes they were to busy, we were rushed a little bit,but overall very helpful"
TAM08181016,I think that charging for the telephone shower handle for the stand alone tub is disappointing!  I would also offer a few more choices in the standard options .  We were also disappointed to know that although We kept our timelines when the construction department fell behind they chose to pin the delay on us and the design center-  this puts a strain on our plans as we need to settle our children before school starts.  This was the one thing that negatively affected our overall great experince with Tamarack!
TAM0809104,Due to the fact we were in need of a quick initial visit and we're not lucky enough to have that we had our close date pushed back 3 weeks. This was caused by either lack of communications between your sales staff and design center or vice versa. Either way our initial visit was 'lost' until we made contact with the sales team expressing our concern. This is when the design center contacted us. Following shortly after was our push back date claiming because we hadn't submitted our final design choices.
TAM0414101,Have prices for custon prodects ready.
TAM08181041,Everything good
TAM0910100,"We do not have the kitchen we want because the sales/design rep did not properly review the diagram received back from the cabinet maker.  As a result, we selected not to do the kitchen upgrade.  48hours before the final selection deadline the mistake was discovered. No time was available to correct your error. This is just a sample of the long list of issues we have had post-sale with the Tamarack Team. If we could get out of the deal, we likely would."
TAM01201028,Better options on tile finishes. We had to drive to Toronto to pick a tile that we wanted. Sending us to Ottawa to do countertop slab selection was also a pain. Using local suppliers would be better not only for the local community but also for the purchasers.
TAM1013111,"they didn't explain me for structure changes.
I wanted to change the front door but they told me that it's too late.
Please explain well for the structure changes."
TAM1114112,Would like to move in faster.  Purchased the home in March and can not move in until November.  :(
TAM0311124,"1. The Sales Centre did not treat us as friendlier as they did before we signed the purchase agreement. 2. The sales centre did not know all the changes that are considered structural. For example, the sales centre did not inform us the presence of the bulkheads in the kitchen and when we asked if the bulkheads could be removed, the sales centre said that would be structural and so too late. When we pointed out that the bulkheads in the model home were not visible and asked what had been done to the bulkheads. Nobody in the Half Moon Bay sales centre and the FC sales centre as well as the Muskoka designer had knowledge of it, not before a dozon emails and many frustrating phone calls.
3. During construction, our questions regarding the construction received no response. After follow-up emails, responses were still very slow."
TAM0810115,"I thought everyone from the sales centre, design center, right to the inspection was fantastic.

Everyone we drove up to the house which was right beside the sales centre, Deb would let us know what they were doing, say hi. She even introduce us to our new neighbor when they were home.

Very good team."
TAM06181033,No comment
TAM06171016,Bath room
TAM0711100,About the design center before they discontinued the product they remove from the sales center and secondly remove the some basic and i prefer add upgrades product .
TAM09191045,"Provide refreshments for the clients during meetings (e.g. coffee, tea, water). Provide a coat rack (especially during spring & winters). Provide a PC with software to be able to visualize colour selections and designs (e.g. kitchen cabinets, flooring, tiles etc.) in conjunction with the house."
TAM1011137,"I would add two or more walk-through checks. It was extremely useful and informative for us to do a walk-through with your excellent foreman (Patenaude Richard in our case).
All questions and concernes were addresses, deficiencies noted and promised to be fixed.

It would be nice to have this process At least once more after the drywall has been installed or after the deficiencies have been fixed.

There was a note about changing certain items after the signed contract. This was unexpected and written in a way that it was final although it is obvious that no changes to the agreement can be made without our consent. your staff was responsive and we smoothed all the items, but if I could change things - I would have preferred not to have had to think about changes to the agreement after the agreement was signed. 

All things considered - we are very happy with Tamarack for the time being - specially with the sales person Sal Magro and our amazing foreman Patenaude Richard!"
TAM0714112,I think I gave a hard time to the staff.  The staff is happy and friendly.  I was stressing and confused about a few things and couldn't control myself.  They did a good job at putting up with me.  They assisted me quite a bit.
TAM1113110,"that I had a negative experience at your design centre with Christine Marsala, I felt very disappointed with her interaction, she was pushing us to select so many upgrades in quick time."
TAM1010121,"We are not very hapy with the lady at design center. There was a mistake on the space for the fridge. We went to design centre and tried to figure out what happend. She said,' I sent everything to headoffice. If they are missing anything on the site, it's the headoffice, not me.' I mean, we don't communicate with your headoffice directly. Whoever working in Tamarack design centre represents the company in front of home buyers. Maybe Tamarack should emphasize this idea to its employees."
TAM09191001,We thought it was more than adequate for our needs
TAM0911109,"1)They should give more  time to the customers
2) There should be more variety for combination/matching of kitchen cabinets and wood flooring.
3) Standard Mixers were not available at the time of our selection"
TAM05181002,Design centre experience was awful. Designer not professional. We got pricing last minute and upgrades list was full of mistakes. Took extra visits and calls to manager to rectify problems. Not confident that our choices will be in our house upon completion. At frame check there was already a mistake. Feel there should be technology so that you can see options in the actual space. You should be able to get custom pricing more quickly and customers need 3-4 visits with a knowledgeable designer.
TAM01181011,Get respond from design center by email is very hard.
TAM0715107,There should be more time at the design center especially when there are many upgrades being selected.
TAM1212106,In the design process to have more visuals of the possible upgrades and what they would each look like in a home. Sometimes with just a sample it's hard to visualize it in the physical home among other decor and upgrade choices. Perhaps implementation of a design software would help clients make a more informed and confident decision.
TAM0316102,"I am not too happy about one thing.  She forgot to tell me about the bathroom.  On top of the bath tub I saw that there was a pot light and she didn't tell me that that was an upgrade and when I mentioned it she said it was too late.  I asked after the walk through. I asked her about it and she said she emailed the head office and they said no.  I am not happy about this at all.  It is not like she is not knowledgeable, I just think she forgot about it.  When she emailed the head office I don't know how she worded the email.  If she said that the client wanted it at the last minute of course they would say no.  I don't think she would admit that she forgot to tell me."
TAM0511120,make so the construction workers do their job by standard.
TAM07191002,None
TAM0511115,"I would allow more access to the home for the buyer during the building process, in particular, immediately after drywalling but before mudding and taping,
I would also provide a form to be filled out during the mechanical walk through to document deficiencies. During my own mechanical walk through I noted several errors that I see have not been addressed. I feel that after a walk through, if problems are found, a follow up walk through should be provided to ensure the problems have been addressed before further work is done.
This is beneficial to the builder as they will not have to repair a finished product down the road."
TAM1114106,Nothing
TAM1214104,"Some of the upgrade costs were outrageous.  As an example, seeing as a kitchen backsplash is a standard feature that Tamarack offers, which means that the cost for the backsplash is in the purchase price of the home, it should not cost $1400 for upgraded backsplash tiles.  I should only pay the difference in material costs.  When priced out, that came to a $200.00 difference.  $1400 is the total cost of labour and material."
TAM0111101,"Because I knew in advance (at the time I signed the contract -February 2010) that I will not be in the summer of 2010 able to do any appointments with design centre, I requested my appointments to be in June 2010.
Unfortunately no one called to book early appointment and I had to call again ( in May) and push to have apointments in June.
All my appointments with the design centre were squeezed in 3 weekes."
TAM1011101,"We have had a very positive experience so far with Tamarack homes.  This is our third 'new' home and by far the best experience out of all the builders so far.  We are very excited to move in to our new home and see the final touchs.  We hope the final product is as good as the service we've had so far.  

We have only one complaint which is unfortunate to have any at all. Finding out that our upgrades on our home were to be added to our final purchase price. City of Ottawa property assessments are based on the purchased value of a home and because of this it created an incentive for us to do aftermarket upgrades instead of purchasing all our upgrades at the design centre. Therefore we would have liked to have paid for those purchases seperatly from our home purchase.  As a home owner we do not feel that it is appropriate or smart to pay property taxes on an upgraded kitchen faucet for years to come.

Thank you so much for everything, looking forward to the big day!!

Stephanie and Dan Stevens."
TAM0613112,More appointment time options in case adjustments need to be made.
TAM1111134,"We have had excellent service at the sales and design centres! The only thing I was annoyed about was a rather rude phone call I received around 7 am one morning (scared me a bit) from Christine in Customer service to book our walk through which we had been waiting six weeks to hear back about , she was not friendly and rather abrupt with answers to my questions, other than that incident we have been very pleased and are getting very excited about our move!
                               Thank you"
TAM06181006,Nothing... This was a great experience!
TAM10191007,We never received our final Purchase Agreement after design options were added.
TAM0611101,I think the whole experience has been very positive.  The only thinng I would have liked to have done is select a color options for the walls.  I found that during the design center process I would mention that I wanted something and was told that we would cover it later in the process and in the end we missed several things.  I blame myself as i should made better notes so as to not to forget anything but I am a little disapointed.
TAM09191008,"Larger samples at the design centre and samples thr client can take away to match with furniture, blinds, etc"
TAM02171004,NOthing.
TAM07181006,"Sales Center : Above excellent service from Joy Kerr.
She was very welcoming, friendly, professionnal, efficient, patient and paid alot of attention to all details. It showed that she has lots of experience and that she likes her job.
Design Center : Excellent service from Mandy Moore.
She really knows her stuff and had a great pleasure in sharing it with us and this always with a smile. She really helped us out with lots of our final choices.  We really appreciated her friendliness, patience and professionalism.
Frame check : Vik was amazing. He paid alot of attention to all our questions.  He was able to answer them immediately and with precision. He was very knowledgeable.

« Dislikes » : 
There were lots of very important decisions to be made at the design center. It is too bad that they do not allow us more time and that they do not provide us with an extra meeting for the representative to help us out with colours, etc. She was excellent in helping us out but she was able to do so only during the « closing meeting » (which made the meeting longer) and that by then most of our choices were already made (by ourselves). Also, would of appreciate if the long list of upgrades would have been online and showed examples (and even colour scheme - - like they did at the sale center for the outside colours)."
TAM0110121,"nothing, overall it was a pleasant experience."
TAM0914112,"The process needs to be more transparent, in all aspects.  All selections for the home should be made at the same time (interior and structural changes).  In addition, more information should be provided when certain upgrades are selected.  For example, maple stairs means maple railings and newel posts at a much more significant cost relative to the actual stairs.  The cost of upgrades are significant and no credit is given for any standards that are foregone (like kitchen backsplash).  This is entirely unreasonable."
TAM04171003,Would have been really nice to know the cost of the upgrades we were putting into our kitchen prior to making our decision.  We wanted to replicate the one in the model home so it shouldn't have been too hard to figure that out.  We ended up with a cabinets we don't really love and frankly will likely look like garbage because the standard white cabinets are hideous.
TAM0513103,Nothing.
TAM10181046,More design to see in actual.
TAM09191036,I would hire a team that can be more caring has more passion and compassion.  I would also make sure my team has product knowledge . Make sure the employees explain and get involved more also suggests more products .
TAM0909113,"More communication from the builder on the time frames for construction, especially when delays occurred and the reasons for them!
Almost a whole year passed before we were even given an approximate date for the start of the house much less a completion date.
When we purchased our home in Oct. 2007, we were told that the expected completion date was the fall of 2008 which did not happen. We finally received a closing date of September 23rd in February 2009."
TAM0915114,"Noella Francoeur is nothing less than amazing,  she is friendly and professionel.  She makes a stressful major purchase an almost worry free experience.  Design Center staff are also friendly and professionel. Kim knows the inventory and provided solid choices. Ewa from Muskoka Kitchens is fantastic.  She lostened to pur needs and provided plans and ideas that will most likely meet our dreams kitchen.

Other suppliers were also very friendly and helpful with the strong exception of the Harding Fireplace Center.  reps at the showroom are unfriendly and not helpful, Tamarack sale rep was unresponsive and not eager to find us the fireplace to suit our needs.  We did the research and made choices."
TAM03182013,I wouldn't change anything
TAM1009106,"Some upgrades were priced a lot higher than we anticipated, especially when we looked at what we thought was the cost of materials for a given upgrade.  It would have helped to have more of an explanation as to why the costs were what they were; for example, by explaining the cost of change orders, admin overhead, and whatever other reasons there were.  We were lucky to have family members involved in the residential industry who were able to explain some of this to us."
TAM05191014,"Sales centre, I hope they could provide me the correct info before my purchase, not after!!! 

For example, on April 2018, I walked in to the sales centre and ask the sales Marg that I would like to buy a town home with a white exterior brick, definitely and absolutely not RED color!!! She replied me with a positive confirm that the exterior will be package #24 with white color brick. Even before I sign my purchase agreement, I double check with her and she told me that there will be a slightly change but the exterior will be white color for sure. 

Three days ago, I dropped off at my town home and I could not believe that the exterior is RED color. Then I asked the sales Marg, she told me that she take the responsibility that offer me the wrong info. 

This is my first home and I worked hard to earn a dream home but the incorrect info made me feels disappointed because if I know the color is RED, I will not sign the purchase agreement no matter what. I hope the senior manager or someone who is in charge of this situation could contact with me.

My email is clarkli@lincolnheights.com

Attached is the email which Marg sent me:

Hi Clark,

 

My apologies for not getting back to you sooner, but I was waiting on replies from head office. 

 

The exterior brick colour on your home is the correct one.  Where the error occurred, and I take responsibility for this, is that I was unaware there are difference between the exterior package boards we have in the sales office for our single family home purchaser’s to choose from and the combination of materials used for the exterior packages for our townhomes….in other words, the exterior boards in the sales office are not what is used for the town homes….they are a combination of materials from the different exterior boards.

 

The exterior package installed on your home is as follows:  the Sutton brick (which is exterior board #28), the vinyl siding is Stratus (exterior board #23), garage door will be black, vinyl shingles (if applicable) 233-Anthractie (exterior board #28), the roof shingles will be Driftwood (exterior board #21/#24/#26/#29) and the front door colour will be Dark Secret.

 

My apologies for giving you incorrect information on what the exterior of your home would look like.  To see what your home will look like finished, you can go to the following addresses in Poole Creek on Warmstone Dr. to view. 

 

93-96 Warmstone Dr. ~ just at the end of your street

 

430-436 Warmstone Dr. just around the corner.

 

I know that you and Yue will still be happy in your new home and it will provide you with many happy memories!

 

Marg"
TAM0310116,We were satisfied overall but felt overwhelmed by all the decisions to be made.
TAM0610117,Have it all in one place instead of going to the different retaillers. More standard options.
TAM0614220,"Maybe the hours they are closed on Friday (all day Friday) -
He could not answer this question(s) He did not meet Design I rated 7:During the design selections experience, the Design Consultant:"
TAM0813105,"There needs to be a model of each type of home withouut upgrades so a potential buyer know what they get for the price listed. Also, more updates on the completing of the house process with possibly a second viewing of the home prior to the pre-delivery inspection."
TAM1212107,I felt rushed during the design process.  An extra appointment would have helped.  More staff working at the design centre.
TAM1011102,"Less nickle and diming (very discouraging when everything has a price tag). 
 Receiving credit for items you are not receiving (eg. we omitted a kitchen backsplash, but received no credit)!
There should be no cost for minor structural changes (eg. we enlarged a bedroom by reducing the size of the laundry room, and in the process, the size of the laundry room window was reduced.  However, we were charged for the changes even though we lost a significant window size!).
More flexibility re. structural changes.  The deadlines are very stringent.
Need more knowledge at the welcome centre."
TAM0113108,Buyers should have a chance to make some changes after the signing contract in the disign centre.
TAM0815119,"We purchased an urban townhome at Chaperal Way in Orleans.  Part of our upgrades selection process we visited other Tamarack projects to see first hand what the end-results of some available features.  Some sites were however not able to provide us with information regarding the upgrades installed in the model homes (e.g. type of hardware floor, ceramic, etc...) but we were told to ask the design centre.  The Design centre were able to answer most of our queries but sometimes we had to rely on pictures taken to pinpoint the upgrades.   Also, we were never provided with a clear pictures regarding when the unit would be transfer to the condo association (e.g. in terms of timelines or percent completion of the housing project)."
TAM0614215,Keep up the good work - The sales department of Tamarack is excellent.
TAM0610104,more updates on the progress made on the house e.g. emails that say the foundation is in etc...
TAM0409100,The information at the design centre with regards to tile options and installation was highly inaccurate.
TAM1009104,"Nothing. Fingers crossed ,everything has gone smoothly so far."
TAM0816134,"Nothing about the sales person.  Pleasant and professional.   The design centre, I was very frustrated and had trouble booking appointments.  I am a full time worker and so is my husband.  We tried to choose the best date for us and the workers at the design centre but that didn't work out for a long time.  The stuff at the design centre wasn't very nice.  When I came back from Europe I realize that I chose wrong colour in the tiles into the kitchen.  I only asked to change the colour of the tile and I was told no that that was not possible.  I asked to talk to someone from head office to see if I could change them.  The designer told me the head office said no.  I know that they do have trouble changing things once ordered and but I would have liked a chance to talk to someone about what happened. I would still like for someone to call me to speak about this from headquarters."
TAM0110117,"We found both the sales and design centre process to be well run and stress free.  However, we did not take part in a blue print meeting.

As first time home buyers and considering the number of entry level homes sold by Tamarack, we could have benefited from an information package detailing each step in the process including legal and tax requirements, what to expect and look for on during site visits, etc."
TAM1115116,Better communication
TAM0914104,no comment
TAM0612118,"If we could change anything about the design process, we would have preferred one Design Centre Representative to work with us throughout the entire process. At times, there seemed to be confusion between the representatives who worked with us. For example, we would make updates, choices, etc. with one rep that would not be communicated to the other."
TAM0512102,ALL the staff at both the sales and design centre were outstanding professionals. Very impressive...especially Louise's team.
TAM1216112,For the design centre I found that one of the ladies was not the most understanding when it came to my availability. I have a job where I can not take time off on that short notice. I  kept telling her my availabilites but she did not listen. She kept giving me times when I could not go to. It was very frustrating. I would have found it easier if the designers worked evenings past 5 pm as well.
TAM1116106,The hours that you guys operate.  I had to take time off work and that wasn't fun.  Everything else was pretty good.
TAM01201003,Nothing everyone was very helpful and treated us well.
TAM10191018,"I would not change anything about sales.
The design center experience was poor and overall didn't have a good experience. 
 I strongly recommend the following for the design center process
 - Designer need to be more proactive in terms of interior selection
 - Communicate in a timely manner with client, reply to every email  in a timely manner.  client should NOT have to send several emails and follow up messages to get clarification
- They need to communicate with the on site crew in a timely manner. When we went for our framing inspection on Tuesday we identified several issues and the site manager showed us they only received the design center document with our changes only the day before on Monday.
- framing inspection need to be scheduled ahead of time and should not be rushed. our was scheduled for the next day when we followed up
- The design center staff at the front desk are not proactive in helping client and never initiate a conversation or offer any help unless you chase them down."
TAM06191024,Be a little more responsive.  Try to communicate the dates of delivery if there is a delay earlier.  If you expecting a delay inform them at least 2 months before.  1 month is not enough time.
TAM08191052,no comment
TAM07181034,"- Provide better and more detailed explanation on the home buying process to buyers especially first time buyers.
- Water heater choice should be left to the prospective buyers. The builder should not force buyers into a long term deal that is purely exploitative. The water heater provided by the company you have chosen to partner with is overpriced by almost 2 fold. The same model and capacity can be purchased at a third of the price. Paying $42-45 every month for a service that may be required once or twice at the most over the lifetime of the heater is exorbitant. The price for buying out of the contract is prohibitively high. Claiming that you care for your customers when you force us into this kind of deal belies your claim to care for your customers.
- The design center should give home buyers more time to consider their selection of upgrades. The buyer should be given more time to go over their selection of upgrades and the associated additional costs. A fourth appointment would also be helpful since the cost of upgrades is significant."
TAM1213117,It's fine.
TAM1212114,"Our only complaint was the time difference between when we were told the design process would begin and when we would have our framing walk-through inspection and the actual time frame when these two activities occured. In both instances, we received emails stating that we would be contacted to schedule our appointments in such a timeframe and the timeframe elapsed in both instances. I had to contact Tamarack and when I did, my appointments were booked. There just seemed to be a lack of follow-up in that area."
TAM06161020,"The experience was great, our design rep was very organized and answered all our upgrade questions quickly.
The frame check done by Steve was very helpful. He took the time to explain what we upgraded and were everything was. We upgraded a wall in the kitchen to be extended (wall against fridge) although it wasn't done at frame check, he make note of it made a call and it was fixed. I'm very impressed how well the Tamarack Sales, Design Center and other areas communicate."
TAM10191046,"Potentially, as a visualization tool, having all selected items from the design centre represented in a digital presentation format. We were also surprised to have been called to book a ""slab viewing"" with Urban Quarry - there was no mention of this appointment in the literature."
TAM06161023,"More time is required for the design selection. We felt extremely rushed.  As for the structural upgrades, Tamarack should allow you to meet with the designer/drafter to discuss these types of upgrades instead of going through Deb Durie in the sales office.  Other builders have this process such as Uniform and we find it's a better option as they are the ones that know best and in the end more timely."
TAM1112112,"I had a question/request to the Sales Rep, which was conveyed to the Sales Manager about the installation of the on-demand Tankless Water Heater. I am disappointed that Tamarack does not make this an option, that I can opt out of this Tankless Water Heater, at no additional cost. If this costs Tamarack more to have Tankless version versus the conventional water heater tank, why not? Tamarack must have a contract with the Tankless Water Heater provider to make everyone to pay for this service provider, Reliance, even though as a homeowner, I prefer the standard water heater tank, as it costs less in monthly rental (almost double the rate of a convential HWT). To me this does not make sense, as I was told by Tamrack that I can do this at my own cost. This was almost a deal breaker to me, if we can find a comparable builder in the area we want to live that offers HWT. I.e. if Tartan offers townhouses (which they don't in this area, only semi-detached), we may have just gone with Tartan!

The Framing inspection was a hiccup when the Site Supervisor was on vacation and another one took over, only to claim that it must have happened half an hour sooner. I came, according to Tamarack, half an hour later and waited for 45 minutes to realize no one came to the inspection at all. There was no email confirmation so that I can verify what I was promised on the exact timing of the inspection. The replacing Site Supervisor was not apologetic but essentially told me I missed it...To me that is not right!

Above are the two noticeable things I like to bring up to your attention. Other than those, during the inspection, the Site Super explained fairly clearly about the quality of the construction, which made me feel better."
TAM1016127,"Design center needs brochures. Items has to be presented vertically. Consider a customer in another city, how would you give him a good design center experience."
TAM1011124,"The sales center reps should be more upbeat when people come in to visit.  We paid many visits to the sales center/model homes when we were trying to decide which home suited us best and after approx. the 3rd visit, we began to get eyes rolling and the sales reps were continually tired and seemed bothered to see us on a repeated basis.  Some consideration knowing that buying a home is a big investment and time and thought and multiple (however many that may be) visits to the sales center/model homes should be expected and appreciated.  The design center process was a piece of cake and enjoyed it tremendously.  The design center reps were professional and new their stuff.  Very much appreciated."
TAM1013131,"Would have like to have had an explanation about how to read blue prints.  We would have like to have more details about the construction process, especially the fact that our house was a backsplit and that it required some changes for the door leading to the garage which impacted on the mudroom and initial plan of the house, this was presented in a big rush and told we had to make a decision right then-when fees are paid for a backsplit, the difference in plans should be presented early on in the design process. We had to make changes we didn't like because Tamarack was unprepared with plans and or options. We did not have option with regard to the choices available for the interlock pavement leading to the stairs of the main door-certainly would not have picked the layout and colour that has been installed.
 Muscoka mobile app was very helpful, but difficult to navigate. Would be nice to have some printed material to take home to make design decisions-we spent hours in the design center, having to leave our children with a sitter. (Ie pics of kitchens with each cupboard style, hardwood-the big decisions.) would like prices listed in the design centre, makes one feel cheap asking about prices all the time. Sad to see our construction site littered with garbage and cigarette butts, particularly since we face a conservation area-it reflects poorly on the subs and Tamarack."
TAM0313106,That in the design center there were more appointments where colour suggestions could be made.  The process in the end felt very rushed and adequate time I don't think was allotted for the signoff as well. I had to take the form home and go over it to make sure that everything was there cause there was not enough time to do so in the office in my opinion.
TAM0213111,"When buying the home for first time home owners being more educated on what will be going up around our home, the home itself and not worried about learning things later on in which in some cases happen to us. Knowing what we can have our say on or change when it comes to the structure of the home etc. Overall good so far however for first time home owners somethings would have been good to know. Thanks"
TAM04191023,"During sales there should be very clear examples of certain features that must be decided on almost immediately during the sales proces. For example, we were never shown an example of the fireplace or explained how the fireplace would look when we purchased, something that we only learned at our design appointment is structural and cannot be changed. This has resulted in us getting a fireplace that we are not satisfied with and could not changed after the fact because it was “too late”. The fireplace is not flush with the wall but rather juts out into the room at least a foot - something we were never informed of and never would have left had we been informed immediately during structural discussions."
TAM0712108,"Sales Process : We received excellent service from Noella Francoeur. 

Design Process : 1) Give more information to buyers for their independent visits to the Design Centre, so that they can make more decisions and understand the upgrade levels better. Colours are not consistent (in some items, blue is an upgrade, in others it is the standard). 2) Flexibility in the hours for appointments with the designer.

Other : Appointments for upgrades with Concept Homes, Alliance Security and others should be booked through Tamarack and be on the same days (and same location) as the Design Centre appointments."
TAM1111136,Additional Examples of what previous clients have done in their homes and approximate costs.
TAM10181012,clearly explain what  are the things to choose at design center and what are the things to consider before (like structural changes). I was not clearly informed about the hardwood stair case (i was thinking that it was design center selection but it turned out to be not)
TAM0615122,"Our experience with the first sales person did not go well. We did not find her knowledgeable or responsive, and found the process very frustrating. She had us to sign a conditional sale agreement too soon in the process, so that resulted in requiring many amendments, additional fundamental questions that had not been answered initially, and probably a lot more frustration on both sides. We came very close to walking away.

We eventually were handed off to another sales person while the other one was on vacation, and fortunately interacted with her only thereafter. At this stage we realized that we had missed critical steps it the process up to this point. Everything went smoothly from then on, and found her to have the knowledge and expertise that we had expected for such an important transaction.

Our interaction with the designer in the design center was very positive. The designer was very knowledgeable, understood our likes and dislikes, and was very personable. We did have several ""the price is what!?"" moments as we learned more details of the costs of various options that we think were outrageous. It is obvious why you don't do this, but it would be very useful for the buyer to know these costs up front BEFORE signing any agreements. It makes it a little impossible to budget without the full information from the design center. This can lead to a lot of little disappointments as you realize that your dream home will be less of a dream than you had imagined before you got the price list... and then had all the piling costs explained to you (for example, the cabinet door upgrades, PLUS the paint upgrade on top of it).

We were disappointed to learn of several things that Tamarack would NOT do for us. We had several inquiries on modern upgrades, like making the home Solar Ready and adding a high-voltage plug in the garage for a future electric car. Tamarack simply refused, which was very disappointing for a brand new home built in 2015. We were also turned down for a few other options that we thought would be straightforward, including pocket doors and skylights. All these features will be much more expensive to add in the future for us. We suggest that you look in to some of these options, particularly the Solar Read and electric car plugs, since this is the future and other developers already have some offerings in this direction. This is a very important influence on my recommendations to friends and family about whether they should choose a particular developer.

Regarding the frame check, it would be nice to receive a copy of the documentation so that we can confirm that everything was recorded properly and nothing was missed. It's not only good for us, but probably much cheaper for Tamarack if a missed mistake can be corrected sooner rather than later. We actually did think of a couple things afterwards that we forgot to check, but had no way of directly contacting the person who took us through the frame check. It seemed difficult and slow to pass that inquiry through our sales person, and I'm still not sure whether it was correct or not."
TAM09171005,"More help, design advice and support in choosing the various options. Design centre employees with more time to give to customers. Also, we were not able to obtain much information before the official referral to the Centre. Otherwise we could have started the planning process earlier thus alleviating much anxiety."
TAM0612116,"- didn't enjoy the reps at Emerald Tile
- i felt there could have been more 'options' presented for fireplaces as upgrades"
TAM0810103,The sales and design centre in Kingston was excellent.  We particularly liked that the model home contains few upgrades.  Other builders' model homes are significantly upgraded making it hard to visualize the starting point.
TAM0511123,Quicker response to upgrade costs.
TAM11191006,Nothing it was great
TAM0712120,"I would of found it really valuable to be able to see colours and designs of tile and flooring online prior to going to the design centre. I think if this was available it may make the selection process easier because then the purchaser would know what they like and dislike. If a software was created for this then the purchaser can save their 'likes' and the design centre consultant can quickly assist the purchaser in finalizing their items. It may also be nice to see a sample room online with the colour tile and paint colours etc - to help the purchaser better visualize the product they are looking at. The service was fabulous! The sales centre even assisted me with finding a doctor in the community, they went above and beyond in their job - they were fabulous!"
TAM04182033,Nothing
TAM09191024,Make it more clear which items are to be selected at the design centre and which are to be selected at the sales centre (structural changes). This process was quite strange and resulted in a but if a mix up (which we believe was resolved) with our master ensuite.
TAM06191036,"We found that there were too many hands in the ""pie"" for the design process and there was a general lack of communication between all concerned. Especially, Concept Homes was difficult to get a hold of and make changes to their plans.  Things became confusing for us and the designer when we went to sign off on the upgrades, an incorrect version of the plans from Concept was being used.  We believe the issue lay with the administration of the file and again too many hands in the ""pie"". 

Despite these issues, our designer (Morgan) was amazing in her design skills and suggestions."
TAM0813114,"Nothing, it was such a smooth andpainless process. Jacquie was just amazing."
TAM0615104,"1. hardwood stain - When we purchased our home, a certain dark chocolate stain was available for hardwood floors, however when we had our selection appointment, that stain was no longer available. We ended up having to pay an 'upgraded' fee in order to get that stain. 
2. We had met with Concept Design to design on home theatre options etc. and submitted to design centre. After a 2nd meeting with concept we a number of changes. We then had to cross reference what was listed in our design centre sheets with the new decisions from concept, which ultimately resulted in something being missed. I feel it would have been better to 'delete' all of our initial concept decisions and 'replace' them with the new decisions. a 'cut and paste' from concept woud have eliminated something being in our manual cross referencing.
3. we purchased our home in release 1. when release 2 came out, tamarack was now offering other upgrades as standards ie soft drawer close. That should have been offereing and or included in all purchaser standards regardless of what phase they purchased in. It would seem to be a better sales pitch to offer more standards in the initial release, rather than offering more standards in subsequent releases. Makes one think they should have waited for further releases as more might be included in price."
TAM0712128,"Nothing I can think of now, however, I feel the need to mention that cost of some upgrade options struck me as being very overpriced.  

Kudos to your design centre staff, ie Carly, Kim and Ewa as they are very knowledgeable, patient and very helpful throughout a difficult process."
TAM0414112,No change
TAM0717104,The standard features should have more higher quality options.
TAM1013115,The design centre should have a very clear and up to date catalog of all possible upgrades. We have spent hours deciding our upgrades to find out that some were not available or the price was completely different than the ones first showed to us.
TAM0610137,The supply of homes.  All of Tamarack's bungalows have been sold out for ages.  We would of bought one two years ago.
TAM09191016,More options for standard items and more appointments in design center
TAM08181046,"Have a computer at design center where by entering product number and house model number, upgrade prices are available."
TAM10191057,"At the beginning maybe give time frames , on when the design centre will call , when to expect the mechanical walkthrough and final inspection, none of this was told to me in the beginning so I was left in dark , as I have no sense when to expect things"
TAM0914116,Nothing so far!
TAM02201020,"We felt pressured for time as our file was due the same day as our final design center appointment which we were probably informed before hand but didn't fully understand the implications (I should note these are the dates that were provided to us for appointments we did not reschedule any). During the kitchen selection process we were told to make a wish list and that we could subsequently change but when we went back for final appointment the kitchen changes weren't made because the person wasn't in that day (e.g. we would have chosen a less expensive hood fan as this was not a need it was a wish list to see if we came under budget). This added stress to our process as after HST (b/c luxury home in CRA mind) it put us over what we were hoping to spend. My recommendation would be to not have the file due the same day as final appointment and if this is the case, don't tell client that they can make changes if it will risk their file being delayed, as we could have made more inexpensive choices. Otherwise it was a good experience."
TAM01191011,Offer more standard options
TAM0514106,Nothing.
TAM04182022,Provide more options at the design centre or have a catalogue of the possible upgrades
TAM1213105,"We had a really good relationship with the Design expert and loved her expertise and knowledge. At the same time, it would be useful to have increased support and/or some online means or tools for role-playing ourselves with different scenarios on upgrades and for seeing right away the costs implications of those on our budget, rather than having to wait for a formal meeting to turn over the upgrades agreement and only to then see what the costs implications of our choices had done to our budget."
TAM07191006,Nothing in particular
TAM1213113,No comments as they were very friendly and very knowledgeable of their work.
TAM0111110,"We felt that during the sales process we were misinformed and often told things in order for the sale go through.  We really did not get a positive vibe and were disappointed with the service we recieved.

However,  it is important to note that the experience we had at the design centre was excellent.  Mandy was our designer and she could not have been more helpful.  Whenever we had questions she was always available through email or phone.  Mandy was even a big help in fixing some of the problems and clarifying some issues that occured during the sale maeetings.  When it came to picking our colors and upgrades in person she was very honest and helpful.  Even though the required meetings happen quickly and you need to be prepared, we never felt rushed during the selection process.

We have seen some of the beautiful homes that Tamarack has built and we are looking forward to our closing date to see the finished product!"
TAM1110105,"The sales experience was fine,but I find that there were too many patterns of tiles and countertops to choose from."
TAM12171011,Getting our selection to site office in a more timely fashion to avoid putting in the standard and then removing to do the upgrades. Seems unnecessary work is being done.
TAM0213104,"Nothing. My experience has been fantastic. Deborah at the Chaperal sales center is exceptional, kind, and very welcoming. Kim Knuth at the design center was fun, experienced, gave great advise and kept us within out budget. I am very happy with my purchase and I am very much looking forward to moving into my new home in Feb 2012."
TAM0717115,Nothing that I could change
TAM04182004,so far good
TAM0713115,Keep the selection materials up to date in design certre. We're informed that our carpet selection was no longer available more than one week after the contract has been signed. It is quite frustrated.
TAM0610101,"Little things 1) In the Bristol-back bedrooms have closets that act as natural sound barrier between two rooms.  The is no sound /insulation between master & 4th BR.  We were told, we would have had to advise at time of purchase if we would have wanted insulation.  It wasn't until the frame inspection did we discover this & at that point it was too late.  Something to keep in mind for the future. 2) We never though we would have to shop for appliances before the design center.  Suggestion instead of saying fridge should be no more than 32', indicate what actual opening size is.  This would avoid a lot of confusion.
Thanks & can't wait to move in 13 days! We hope!"
TAM1012111,"individuals not following through on their previous commitments
never willing to accommodate / the answer is always ""NO""
There were also other issue with the pricing of the upgrades on this property that were not meet but I am not sure if this is the kind of thing you also want to hear about. If so please let me know I will share the concerns and issues and not to mention the frustration these issues has caused me.  I will provided you with just one little example, it’s really VERY DISSASPOINTING  when the owner of Tamarack  does not return your call.    

I had an inspector come with us during the rough in inspections and  whenever the inspector advised what items needed to be fixed there was always resistance.  As a matter of fact,  I sent an email on June 20/12 at 1:55pm to several Tamarack individuals advising them what needed to be fixed (two items in particular that are causing me much concern, the first one was an electrical wire what was cut in our master bathroom and the second were couple moldy wood studs (I think the sizes were 2x4's or 2x2's) located in our kitchen ceiling and in around of our fire place mantel.  
However, to this day no has responded to my email.  I know that this things were not done / fixed because during the inspection there was a lot of push back on them and indicating that this was not an issue.  I am still very concerned with this as this is a fire hazirous and I have a little girl who suffers from allergies, so I am very scared that in the future these two items will in an issue. 
I have enclose a copy of the original email I sent to all the Tamarack individual.  Here is the copy.

 


I have to say that I am very disappointed that no one cared enough to even respond to this email.  This speaks volumes to us indicating that they do not care.. 

Here is a copy of the email encase you are not able to open it..

Subject: Report for 387 Grammond Circle


Hello Debbie Champange and Vic, 

Enclosed is the report on the deficiency’s that our inspector provided on our house at new 387 Grammond Circle after he completed his inspection of the property on June 19, 2012..  The inspector Georges Messerey did address most of these with Vic so that they could be fixed prior to insulation.  

Although all the items on the report need to be fixed  and are equally important the following are the ones that need close attention and need to be changed asap.  

They are following:

3. Damaged sheathing on electrical wire near junction box for light above cabinet for ensuite wall
light. This could possibly be a fire hazer in the future.

10. Moldy looking studs noted framing for fireplace.  These are the floor to ceiling wood frames.

22. Crooked wall noted at kitchen wall under window. This will impact the placement of future granite contour tops that I will be installing when I move into the house.

23. Mold like stains were noted on strapping on kitchen ceiling and alongside on main beam on ground floor. 

The moldy strappings and framing wood needs to be changed.  I have a little 4year old girl who suffers from allergies and if not changed this could possibly impact her in the future as the wood would get worse with time.  I would really appreciate if careful attention was noted to this request and completed. 

Enclosed is the report with pictures.. 

  


I trust that these items will be addressed and fixed.. If I missed anyone from the Taggart team that I missed on this email and should have been copied on, can you please send it to them. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at 613-355-7318

We Appreciate your help.  Thank you in advance, Natalie and Miguel Amorim 
Thank You!

TAM0614105,"I would like my sales to know more about the house. We spent some time to figure out whether it has hydro meters on my side wall and the drawing showed nothing. The sales told me I can trust the drawing but turns out there are still four hydro meters on my wall. I don't have to spend that much time if she knows about the construction more clear.

The design center is pretty good and when I asked for a site visit I got reply very soon and the foreman is also nice."
TAM0116102,I am not sure.
TAM06181009,it would be better to provide some following up  information to the clients who are not in Ottawa by sending some emails to show how is the house construction going and so on
TAM09191017,sales reps has no knowledge and exempt of empathy
TAM0611109,more flexibilty with making structural changes. I'm a structural engineer and you provide NO flexibility or open mind to making changes I was willing to pay for (design and construction costs)
TAM05191003,"Feel rushed by the builder once we hit the design center with limited time with the representative. 
Sales Reps and Design consultant are great,   builder should allow more time."
TAM0210119,"Was completely happy with the people at both the sales and design center.
I had to book my last design appointment very quickly as I was informed that my closing date would be extended as I had not made my final selection.  I was still well within my 45 days and was very upset.  The design center fit me in with an appointment the following day and everything fell into place.  My one recommendation would be that the sales center and the design center have a little better communication."
TAM0711122,"It is a bit tricky to work with people both on the West and East end of town. We are currently having trouble because we asked for a change to be made prior to the drywall being installed and have just found out that our home has been drywalled and the change was not made. In this instance, communication was difficult. We also found it difficult to work with the contractor from Concept for our speaker wires."
TAM06171002,Prices are a lot higher then any other builder and resale wise it is not a good investment
TAM08191034,None
TAM0612112,Little bit more time and some more flexibility in being able to make changes (such as after home inspection)
TAM0111114,"Design centre process - too rushed - more time when signing off.  Initial app. was great with (Mandy) more time would of been better.  Designer (Christine) doesn't know her pricing well.  Is always too rushed, no final check list to make sure you have everything, you have to  make your own.  She also has a short fuse & usually it's because she caused the problem with missinformation.  You should have pricing on your kitchen handles, it caused lot's of agravation, first were given wrong pricing having to choose different ones only to find out later that the pricing on the first ones was just fine.  When we asked at the final meeting do we have everything the answer was I don't know. When you've chosen so many upgrades that answer does not leave you with a good feeling.l"
TAM1015136,"Since the house already had the ceiling done, we had no control over wanting to have a smooth ceiling.  As well the rinnai water heater, we had no choice but to rent from it or buy it (inflexible options).  As well wasn't too happy with the price of the gas line.(Too high)."
TAM04191014,"I visited the décor center prior to my scheduled appointment, during my visit the center was very rude and had attitude.  The were not very friendly and displayed attitude.  They where not friendly and in fact made me feel like they where doing me a favor.   

During my scheduled appointment I felt rushed as the décor consultant had a deadline to meeting.  I felt pushed to make a decision.  The should be more flexible and provide the homeowner with more time to make decision. 
 
There is room for improvement in this department,  training on customer service and allow the homeowner to more time to decide on selections.   I am happy because everything did work out the way I wanted but there was a lot of pushing from my side. 

I did attend the frame walk-through but the it was a VERY cold day and talked for 1  1/2hours outside.  I did not know  what the purpose of the scheduled meeting and had no idea what was suppose to happen."
TAM01191010,emphasize on the structural changes
TAM0612125,"Not feeling rushed during the design centre appointments or made to feel difficult when asking questions or unprepared.

Would suggest providing client's a clearer understanding of the design centre process; to briefly outline in advance of what to expe"
TAM1112122,"nothing to change, we are highly satisfied"
TAM0710102,The main thing I would change would be an opportunity to have had more walk through's.  We only had one walk through the day before closing and that was it.  I would have liked to have had the chance to see the interior of the house as it progressed.  That's probably the only thing I would have liked to have been done differently.
TAM1012117,"Would you recommend some suggestions (which kind house or design suitable for them) for some buyer, when they are purchasing a house? Sometimes buyer need listen sales or designers. Thanks."
TAM02172000,Give more time to make selections
TAM1112117,"The initial referral form was misleading, the rep pressured me into filling out a form, but I didn't know that filling it without including our friend's name would impact our ability to take advantage of the referral bonus once we have decided to buy. I think that the sales rep should ask for the referral once an initial sales agreement is signed. The house-buying process can be long, and it is possible that someone shopping around the model homes may end up choosing Tamarack because of a friend's recommendation."
TAM07181040,Nothing. Everything was perfect
TAM10191006,"We would have liked to get a walkthrough after the electrical changes. That's very disappointing.

I drove by the house in May on a Saturday night at 5 ou 6pm. All the workers' were gone and the door to get Inside our house from the garage was wide open. I closed it myself to make sure no wild animal would go in there. There are a lot of mice in that area, we have seen them running around on debris outside the house, so it's disappointing to see that workers just left the door open like that.

We were disappointed that we didn't have options to upgrade the chandelier. It's not something we can easily change ourselves because it's in the open staircase.

We were also disappointed with the paint colors. We wanted to get an accent wall painted but there was no dark colors to choose from at the design center. It would have been nice to see a dark grey like in the Cardiff model home in Findlay creek."
TAM1110128,It would be nice to receive a copy of the blueprints before going to the final design centre meeting.  This would help determine electrical changes we want to make.
TAM0310114,"When I call the desing Center, it would be nice if I could reach a clerk at the reception desk and not only provide me a number system for me to leave a voice mail. 

Kim my design rep was fantastic!! 

Thank you
LANA LEBLANC :)"
TAM1118119,"Sales centre process is very efficient. Appreciated the quick responses to any queries. Thank you to the team. 

Design centre staff were very welcoming. They were helpful and very responsive to requests for additional product information and/or installation options. I appreciated the suggestions and options provided both in meetings and in follow up correspondence. 

Having online access to photos of the main choice boards on display at the Design Centre would be a useful companion resource to the option catalogue as one goes through the selection process. 

Thank you."
TAM08172005,"It would have been good to have a walk through either before or during the design centre process, before the trimming began.
It would also have been extremely helpful to have had access to a computer application showing my model, where I could actually see the colour options I was selecting as it applied to the actual model design."
TAM0314106,To have more pictures of completed models on the website in order to provide customers with design ideas for the models they choose to build.  Eg. Pictures of home exteriors and kitchen layouts.
TAM1010103,"Sales : honest staff that does not increase the cost without notice. Knowledgeable staff that advises about limitations of structural upgrades early in the process of choosing lots.

Design: more time with design consultant... the few hours is not enough to select all the finishings..."
TAM07181043,"Nothing, I am always greeted with a smile. The staff will accommodate my needs as I am from Kitchener. Long distance means I can only be at the house during certain times. The reason why the house wasn't cleaned up when I visited for the Frame inspection is because again, they accommodated me in allowing me to do the check before it was completely done. The site supervisor was excellent and very knowledgeable. There was no construction going on at the time of the visit therefore I didn't see a need for the safety equipment during the visit, offered or not!  Overall, great service, excellent knowledge and professional staff. Excellent company with reputable trades."
TAM10181042,"Sales- They need to be transparent and clear on the timeline and options. We were not provided ample time to select our exterior. I was showed a brick color and when i asked if it would look like the house there the rep said yes. However, when we saw our house the bricks didn't match for what we selected and were told. We paid extra few thousand dollars for extending the cedar deck and we got pressure treated wood deck as they said that from 2018 the only build pressure treated wood deck. If a customer pays for gold and gets silver for that amount, I am sorry to say it is called FRAUD. The sad part is we were not even informed that they build a pressure treated deck.

Design- Reps are  not up to mark,very poor knowledge of the designing. We were not offered a lot of upgrade options. When we asked for quote for upgrade they made it difficult. After numerous emails and clarifications we still had a lot of mistakes. Wrong upgrades were done.  I would highly recommend that Tamarack replaces the employee or train them. I am sorry to say but people will go to other builders. Buying a new house is a happy moment but we were and are still stressed. It takes a lot of ours and Tamarack's  time to get everything sorted out and corrected."
TAM0311123,"Nothing, went very well."
TAM0312105,- DO NOT OVERCHARGE FOR SO CALLED 'UPGRADES' THAT ARE NO DIFFERENT IN PRICE THAN THE STANDARD IF YOU COMPARE PRICES AT SUPPLIERS; YOUR COMPANY JUST PICKS THE UGLIEST AND POOREST STANDARDS TO FORCE CLIENTS TO PAY EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS FOR UPGRADES (THAT ARE RE
TAM03191013,"The selection of hard wood at the design centre located in the building all need to be included in the choice for home buyers.  We were informed to not even consider looking at one wall since this was for other homes not ours. Also, Muskoka provided us with a layout of the design of our kitchen on paper.  This was helpful, however with technology it would be great to have a virtual design of what our kitchen would like to have a better review in order to accommodate any changes.  This was the largest upgrade to the home."
TAM1010101,Have more of the exterior colour samples on site.
TAM0815112,It would be helpful to receive a better understanding of the backyard landscape.  We paid for a premium lot with trees to create privacy and it's not as of now what we expected and understood.
TAM0414119,It would be nice if they opened earlier in the day. Otherwise we enjoyed our experience very nice people.
TAM0316101,n/a
TAM01181015,Everything was perfect on time and professional
TAM04182001,"Nothing, they are super."
TAM0711132,Ensure that prospective buyers are aware that bonus dollars advertised are tax included which means less value than expected at the deign centre. Perhaps a reduced bonus or a bonus that does not include tax would be more up front and therefore not a surprise disappointment when revealed.
TAM09191006,"The sales centre is fine but design centre  is a sales trap. The standard products offered are outdated to force you into upgrades that are priced at many times 
 over the real and fair market value."
TAM0815113,"Design centre process felt rushed to make decisions.  Also, it would have been nice to have running totals of projected costs for options selected.  The first time seeing total costs for upgrades is very close in time and date to signing off on things.  It would have been a lot better to have running totals at each visit, because to change one thing could have a cascading effect and could impact various other decisions.  It was made clear that there was limited design centre time, and more time would not be provided if you were going to start making  significant changes near the end.  We felt we had no idea what the total costs were, and then it was impractical to try to make changes that we would like and could be sure would not impact other choices."
TAM0812119,"It would be helpful if you could conduct a pre-selection of interior materials and upgrades virtually - either on-line or at a terminal in the design centre.  Via digital imagery, clients could experiment with different options in a simulated room.  In this manner, colours, textures and materials could be compared - giving the clients a better feel for what works.  The total price could also be tallied as they select options.  After selecting the various options, they could meet with a representative to discuss and confirm their choices.  This could serve to help clients make more informed decisions.  It would also reduce the amount of time a representative would need to spend with each client."
TAM0510119,"Ever since I first stepped into the Model Home Sale Centre, everything has gone fantastically smooth.  I would change absolutely nothing about the process."
TAM04191019,Décor Center Receptionist was horrible and awful.  She rushed out and provided wrong information about upgrades.  I was fortunate to have a family member attend the appointment with me that was knowledgeable about the upgrades.    Sales consultant was great!
TAM12191021,"We had a terrible and stressful design centre experience. We were confined to very limited appointments and were rushed to make choices. The number of appointments and the availability of design consultant should be based on buyer's needs and budget. The pricing for custom choices should be available at the design centre without going back and forth to the head office.

Design Centre Issues - Our design consultant came least prepared during our first meeting, totally unaware of our structural upgrades. It seemed to us that she came with a pre-conceived notion that all our choices will be made during the first meeting itself. We were rushed and felt very overwhelmed after that appointment and yet we were told that we only have one final meeting left. Not all buyers stick to basic options or rely on design centre bonus to make upgrades. The process would be more effective and efficient if we had got additional time with the designer rather than having all the communications through email. We had to correct multiple times on the selections we made as she kept missing them in her email updates. During the frame walk-through we found out that the site crew did not even have the updated/final design selections.

Custom Pricing Issues - Many custom prices provided to us did not make sense. We had to go back multiple times to correct their mistakes and quotes. An online tool would be really helpful.

Building Issues - The site crew missed an additional window (upgrade) in the basement, even when it was clearly documented in the blueprint. They had to cut open the concrete to add the window after we reported this to them. The ultimate shock was when we came to know that they mixed up the Ensuite and Laundry room windows. Just 2 weeks before the closing, they had to rip open everything and replace the windows.

We are crossing fingers and hope that we will have very few issues to go through during PDI and stress-free closing."
TAM0910117,"There are no major changes to be made I was very pleased with the sales rep I had, Noella Francoeur, she was very informed on the Tamarak product and accepted to do the walk through on the property inspection when I could not be there (reason I did not respond to those questions).  At the design centre I had the great fortune of working with Christine Marsala who is a wiz when it comes to making color and material choices, and innovative choices, within a very short window of appointment time.  Sheri Sinclair, another efficient design centre worker quick turn around on resolving  admin issues.  Overall great job from everyone, maybe some extra staff at the design centre for peak periods and more experienced staff like Noella in sales.  Other than that.....
Bravo Zulu Tamarack!!"
TAM03191008,design centre could have an online portal to create a 3D virtual image of selections inside the specific housing floor plan
TAM09191012,Nothing.
TAM1115110,"I know that it may be a detail for you but the standard choice of grout is not a very nice color that doesn't match with most of the tiles. Also the cost of 200$ to upgrade the grout is not acceptable. I was bothered with this situation because this company offers so many beautiful options for everything (tiles,floors, carpet, counters, ....but just 1 color of grout). I do not understand.  I wish that you would reconsider this. Thank you!"
TAM0413110,Nothing.
TAM1012129,"Sales rep need to be kind before and after the customer buy a house, and be understanding with the client"
TAM0712115,"I understand that within 90 days of the original closing date, you can receive a notice of a delay in the closing. It might be worth considering sending the homebuyer a short message even if there will be no delay in closing.... It is always nice to have a positive notification rather than waiting to see if you will be getting a letter or not.

Thanks"
TAM1116100,other than the issue with the frame check / late design centre appointments our experience with tamarack has been great.
TAM04171024,Not to have to go back to the design Center to repeatedly  sign paperwork  that should have been completed  correctly  the first time.
TAM1112127,"The Sales Centre Representatives are great.  The site supervisor and his coordinator (I think it is Christine) are great.  The design centre representatives are not so great, in comparison to every one else.  And that was disappointing."
TAM01191007,"Nothing.  I have been 100% satisfied with the process so far. 
They have been very accommodating to me.  I showed up a day early for my frame check in apt and instead of sending me home, they made the time for me to go through the house. 
The design center ladies are always very friendly and helpful and I trust their expertise to make sure I have chosen ""nice"" things for my new home.  
Thank you for remaining a quality builder!"
TAM0413113,More room would be nice in the design centre. There could be more on display and a broader selection of upgrade options
TAM01201012,"Nothing, its been great."
TAM0112109,Process was good...people were polite and knew there stuff....not like monarch
TAM1115118,Everything was fine but we were n told that the telephone jacks could be used as internet connection that was what we were told (?). I don't think homeowners should buy a house without eavesthoughs.
TAM05191019,N/A
TAM0716106,See proposal on Walk-through question
TAM06181016,An obvious omission during the sales process is the lack of explanation of the water tank rental agreement. This could been explained in more detail.
TAM0816101,More bathroom options for layout.
TAM07181046,nothing- everything was perfect.
TAM0613101,"Hours of operation, longer evening hours."
TAM07191004,"The Sales centre has been great - very informed - and our Sales prime , Noella, has been extremely helpful in all matters and concerns.

WRT the Design centre, responses to emails and phone messages were not always forthcoming.  It appears that add'l staff to handle the heavy load would be helpful."
TAM1212117,Ensuring the pricing in the catalogue for the extras are accurate. The catalogues are specific to each model home therfore the pricing should be accurate for any changes. Buyers do not like suprises when it comes to pricing changes regardless of the amount.
TAM0815117,"Design centre - choosing upgrades is very complicated and it should be a simplified one step process not several steps for example to choose the item for example kitchen cabinets, then red green yellow dots and related upgrade costs and finally choose the item colour. The price for choosing colour is separate.  Same thing choosing a carpet, color code dots etc."
TAM1213111,it would be good to have a better range in the operating hours.
TAM0312103,"Our sales center experience was fantastic ...everyone from Sal to Darlean were extremely welcoming and helpful. Our design center experience on the other hand felt a little more cold. It felt extermy rushed. We are first time home buyer so this process of what to choose and what not to choose is completely new to us, so after the signing off of our upgrades they're we're a lot of things that were brough to our attention by friends that I felt should of been mentioned by or design rep. No suggestions were offered to us by her at all, and again the entire process felt uncomfortable. Another point that really annoyed me about the design center is that it is IMPOSSIBLE to get a hold of someone there ... They never answer the phones."
TAM0511118,Outside contractors like those for home entertainment felt like an obstacle.  Options should have been available like all other upgrades.
TAM03191004,"No safety was provided.  The inspector did have his hard hat on and we did inquire about the safety gear but said it was not needed.  

Sales: Would have been nice to know that our exterior décor example color of brick/door color and garage.  We assumed it would have been the same exterior colors as the model home.  To our surprise our brink was fire red and not the nice grey.  

Décor Center:  with todays technology the center should be able to provide a digital picture of the color selection.  Example:  how the kitchen would look with the cabinets counter tops and flooring. selection.   It is hard to envision if colors selected would be nice together."
TAM0313104,All in all the service is pretty good.
TAM0510143,"I believe this is actually happening as we speak, but in Kingston you have to drive around to different suppliers to pick out flooring, cabinets, countertops etc. It makes the process very time consuming and frustrating. They need to have their own design center like they have in Ottawa."
TAM0912119,"Found at times when we sitting going through things with the designer that people were coming and going --- distracting.
Room to dark."
TAM0611103,"EVERYTHING!!!!

Nothing is customer focused - not even this questionnaire (data gathering - period!). 
There is no attention to detail in the documentation process. Hopefully your building process pays more attention to detail than your administrative process.
There is no communication between Kingston and Ottawa - as witnessed by the random email we got from our representative Terry and the incorrect email address used in the letter we received from Christopher Taggart (attention to detail!). 
Documentation is abnormally slow to be received via the pony express once a week from Ottawa - email, scanners, faxes, 2011..... anyone?
Your staff are unable to clearly communicate 'standard' vs. 'upgrade' or to provide pricing on anything prior to purchase - ridiculous. 
The process, is bizarrely slow (for a company in the business of selling houses), laborious and has been a drain or our time, our realtor's time and our lawyer's time. 
Your 'design centre' staff are unhelpful, self important and unavailable to answer questions. 
Your staff are unable to react to anything (i.e. mistakes in documentation)without going via Ottawa - who take a week (at least) to respond to anything. 
Your documentation is out of date, but no one appears to be interested in updating it (HST was introduced a while back!). 
Everything is focused on Tamarack getting what it requires, but not on the customer having their needs met. (Taking two weeks to put TWO signatures on a 9 page agreement - not signing all the places it says Tamarack should sign and calling it 'standard business practice'). 
Whoever is advising you on customer service, marketing and sales is doing a VERY VERY poor job. I've been advising blue chip clients in this area for years and to even use the term 'customer service' here quite frankly is embarrassing.
We get much better (and more courteous) service from our car dealer and our cars cost a fraction of what this home costs. 
Your staff in Kingston, are uninformed, arrogant and seem to have no understanding that a purchase of this cost requires and in fact demands a high level of customer service, basic manners and etiquette. As I've already mentioned, I get better service for items that cost a fraction of what this home costs. 

You are in the fortunate position of owning a company that is able to make the buying and design process smooth, fun, easy and hassle free for your customers, yet you choose to make it hard, frustrating and mind-numbingly painful. I can only wonder at the number of customers you have lost by handling business this way. 

By the way, don't 'thank me' by offering me $500 so you can earn $350,000+ from the sale of a new home. That helps you more than it benefits me. If you really want to say thank you, then do something that only benefits the customer. That is what a true 'thank you' really is. If you want to introduce me to your referral programme that's fine, but don't hide it behind a 'thank you' - it's insulting to customers that have brains and actually are marketing savvy. 

We were led to believe that Tamarack homes had a high level of service and excellence - boy were we wrong. 

Quite frankly the whole process has been a huge disappointment and we are wondering if we just made a 400K big mistake. I guess we will only know when the house is complete. 
We were using this as a test market, because our main family home is in Ottawa and we were considering buying a Tamarack there too if this went well. I can assure you, we will not be buying another Tamarack home and we will not be recommending the company to anyone else. 

Please ensure these comments get passed to Christopher Taggart, he should know how frustrated and let down his customers feel."
TAM12181008,More transparency and communication during the build process.
TAM0715103,"Having to wait and stand in lines to make the purchase when both we, and the sales staff, knew we had been waiting for the release for well over a year and were going to move forward doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense??  I really don't understand the advantage to either Tamarack or us when a guaranteed sale is there!!"
TAM06171004,"The sales part had an issue with our home being a ""reverse"" plan; it caused issues for both us and the sales agent in getting requirements properly assigned - it caused frustration on our side and required previous email traffic to be provided to prove our requirements!  Having a set of reverse plans for each home at the sales office should be standard practice as I am sure that all models are being built in both standard and reverse layouts.  The design centre personnel were professional and helpful; however, the design centre was in the throws of being moved and the presentation and availability of design parameters was limited or not fully functional for many of our visits."
TAM02191008,Notiong
TAM0810118,Having more time for the second appointment.  Getting quotes back faster.
TAM0717123,Having more information given to prospect. I went to all of your Sale center the one that did an outstanding job was the one in Kanata. They make us feel like family. The personal touch in sending a handwritten card made us feel like we weren't just a number or just a prospect in your data base. Because of that I put my offer in Kanata but my fiance like Barrhaven better so we settle there. If you do want to conduct sale training I will suggest you use your team in Kanata as an example of professionalism.
TAM0112108,"Would have beeen nice to have a design centre in the Greendpark subdivision. 
The kitchen design was a major part of customizing our home. Even though the staff here in Kingston did a great job helping out, I would have liked to have met a rep from Muskoka Cabinets here in Kingston to discuss design possibilities. I did not have time to go to Ottawa and ended up doing everything via telephone and email. Even though the job got done, the process was at times frustrating. 
All for now, thank-you for your excellent service."
TAM0115100,"We were told that if we completed the design centre quickly that we could have a bumped up move in date (my wife is pregnant so it was important for us to do this). It took weeks and numerous follow up phones calls to Deb Champagne for this to happen. Although I am satisfied with the new move in date, I wish this process would he been smoother."
TAM01181006,"Great experience, Morgan was great and went out of her way to provide samples of some tiles I liked at the tile store to show them in person with the other choices I made."
TAM1014122,I think this process is very effective and well organized. Team were excellent
TAM0412121,I want to move in asap :)
TAM0614221,we did not do the design center
TAM12191010,Design center seems hard to understand and navigate if you go on your own and everyone is busy. I like tamarack for the quality but mattamy had a more user friendly design centet.
TAM0910103,Everything went smoothly and everyone I was in contact with were helpful and pleasant to deal with.  Overall a great experience.
TAM0414102,Nothing really. We had a wonderful experience from start to finish. The ladies at the sales center/showhome in Orleans were always very friendly & knowledgeable. We are satisfied so far with our experience and hope to have the same service from start to finish!
TAM0515103,"Frame Check:  we were given 3 days notice for us to complete a frame check.   We were sent an email on a Monday, late afternoon and expected to drop our shifts or clear our schedule to complete by the Thursday.  we were departing for an out of country trip on the Wednesday morning.  When we advised we couldn't accommodate we were advised that unless we could do it Tuesday, we would not be able to do a frame check as the drywall would be completed before we came back the following week.   This was stressful and completely unnecessary.   A bit more planning and notice from Tamarack would have made the first experience in our new home much more pleasant, rather than the stressful schedule bending we had to do to fit it in before our trip. I would expect that we will have much more notice for our pre delivery inspection."
TAM08171005,Very satisfied and everyone is very professional
TAM0913118,not a thing
TAM05191005,"It was great to see all the samples under one location. Design center should have bilingual employees or should adapt their speaking when asked to. Employees should be equipped with tablet to accelerate the product selection which would allow more time to design select: it took way to much time for the designer to write down all the selected product; this is not a good time employment for such an expert. The catalogue is great, it should be in PDF form to allow searching in the document instead of a PDF image. There could be links to images to show the product in the design center to facilitate the buyer selection of the product thus facilitating being ready for the appointments with the designers. This would save time to the buyers and to the designers."
TAM0713102,"Have a Tamarack representative be the middle person between the client and stakeholers (concept home, fireplace, ceramic...)."
TAM0712101,"The initial girl who showed us around, didn't seem to know much. Couldn't answer barely any of our questions on how things would work.. It wasn't until our appointment with the designer that we understood everything"
TAM0510129,The sales centre is find.  The salespersons are helpful.  The design center is another story.  The prices of all upgrades should be clear and we shouldn't have to go and shop for certain items and wait for quotes. There is a lack of communication between sales centre and design centre. There is also a lack of communication between sales centre and site manger.  We are currently having problems with the relocation of 2 ceiling lights.  We inform the site manager of this problem as well of the salesperson but they don't want to do anything about it.  We have been fighting for a week now and once the ceilings are sprayed it would be impossible to fix it.  They were made aware of this before the ceiling was put on and didn't want to make changes.  The location of the dining room ceiling light fixture will mean that our dining room table will be sitting in the middle of the hallway!  Also the entrance ceiling light fixture is almost near the wall!  We also feel that the front door opens on the wrong side but the blue print is misleading and they don't want to change the opening saying that it is part of the structure.  This means that we will not be able to put a small bench in the entrance because the door opens that way.  We are very very frustrated.
TAM0413116,To be more informed about all my options before buying.  The sales person was not educated to the different models
TAM03171000,"Nothing to change other than please hire me to work in your sales center.  

Thanks, 
Genevieve Allen"
TAM11191028,A bit confusing and overwhelming. Some of the quoted prices for upgrades during the sales process were quite off from the realty when choosing upgrades. May suggest showing potential buyers what the standard options are prior to the sale.
TAM10191000,Everything about the process was to our liking.  Excellent customer service!
TAM0511126,to be more flexible for the outside and inside floor plans
TAM0911123,N/A
TAM09191015,more time with the design center consultant
TAM0811128,"Process has been quite good.  Only complaint is it is sometimes difficult to get time with the sales/design rep.  And no fault of the companies as you can't control staffing, but change of design reps through the process was a bit troubling.

Additional note we have not yet had a walk through of our property.  So survey questions where answered with that in mind.  We did sit down and review the plans, and where told that we would have a mechanical walkthrough in a couple of weeks, but we have not had a framing walkthrough which I thought was part of the process."
TAM0413117,"To have the possibility of seeing floor/wall color combination, upgrades, etc in a computer/simulator"
TAM0816122,"Maybe use an application software tool when going to the design centre instead of writing everything down on paper; and when changes need to be made instead of scratching everything out you can just change it from the software application which makes things easier and cleaner process not to mention efficient. Coming from an IT application background maybe I'm just being picky :)

All in all that's the only thing I would suggest as a change.

TAM01171002,It would be really nice to have the option of changing what countertop and carpet you prefer.
TAM0310100,Your design center had items on display that were no longer available for upgrades....
TAM07191010,"I bought long distance so more information provided by e mail on site & lot locations would be good. I just had the online map to go by. 
Design centre rep was beyond amazing! Very helpful for the one day I had there that I flew in for. After mtg assistance was phenomena!! But, you should have more tile samples & options available. It’s a $$$ investment & more choices would be great, especially since the Model Homes show finishes that are not available, so I’m not sure why models are done like that. It is cost prohibitive to change tiles etc after so a bigger selection would be really welcome. Expensive homes should have some higher level of customization; don’t mind paying for it. Please let people have a shower niche!!!"
TAM11191019,A virtual space to be able to visualize the options being selected
TAM0912111,More opportunities to make changes.  The deadlines for structural changes were too soon in the building process.  I would have liked to make some minor changes after that.
TAM1010131,Include pictures of finished rooms showing a variety of finishes/upgrades (e.g tiles and granite)
TAM10171039,possibly include a 3D program to view the selections in a completed room. Also make sure that all selections available (tiles etc.) are in stock and not back ordered.
TAM04171001,More time with the designer at the design center.  Or maybe the same time in more visit.
TAM11191007,Communication with the sales representative was not great
TAM01171001,No comment
TAM1110116,"Better coordination and exchange of up to date information between Sales, Design and construction site.

Design: Eliminate the meeting with Muskoka Kitchens and other manufacturers. Customer should be dealing with Tamarack only. Provide complete information regarding the products, i.e. the fact that what the customer will get may not match exactly what is in the design room. Take into account the personal needs and tastes of the client. Do not take it for granted that any customer should or will adopt the tastes and needs of the majority of the customers. Prices of standard products should be substracted from the price of the upgrades, or if you want to charge full price for upgrades, put the standard products in a box and give them to the customer. Hire more design consultants.

Sales: Explain exactly what 'structural' means to Tamarack so that the customer knows what has to be finalized with Sales. take the time to uinderstand what the customer needs to be sure if it should be dealt with at sales stage or at design.

Construction: That is the worst stage and really needs significant improvements. Hire more site supervisors. Hire more competent contractors. Give priority to people with values, who get self satisfaction with a job well done (the behaviour of some is near to vandalism. They do not care of the dirt or of the work done by the precedent contractor). Give importance to brieffing the contractors of the particulars of each home. Ensure that they read the paper work and sketches established at sales and Design stages. Ensure things are done properly from the outset (too much things are done sloppy and left to be corrected later. The final result looks like a rush job, a do-it-yourself instead of a professional work). It is the site inspectors job to ensure that the work of the contractors is coordinated and well done."
TAM0912124,-The design centre should have the prices prepared on all of the different types of flooring for all models on hand. The time-lag to get prices back eats away at our countdown to the final sign-off which isn't fair to a couple trying to work on their budg
TAM08191022,"ALL ARE PERFECT , NOTHING TO BE CHANGED."
TAM0510116,"Needs more than one office space for signing, etc."
TAM0416110,I think one more design centre appointment should be given. But overall experience of mine was still fantastic.
TAM1013118,Perhaps more tools and resources to be able to design your home with a concept in mind. Applications readily a single to give a look of how your design selection will look.
TAM0715121,no coments

Options codes ( standard, upgrade etc) shall be clear to customer."

TAM0710120,"For sales : co-ordination and communication between both, knowledge of sales staff about design centre process. 10 DAYS WINDOW FOR STRUCTARAL CHANGES IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU DO NOT HAVE MODEL HOUSES FOR ALL THE MODELS AND ESPECIALLY WHEN CLOSING IS 12 TO 15 MONTHS FROM BOOKING. \


For design ctr: 3 appt. of 2  to 3 hrs are not enough considering first appt is only to explain std options and upgrades and last appt is sign off. when some one is buying $ 0.5 million house, you have to provide  with enough time  - 4 to 5 appts of 2 to 4 hrs should be considered and PRICING FOR ALL UPGRADES SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED UPFRONT, CURRENTLY JUST BEFORE THE LAST APPT. PRICING ARE AVAILABLE WHICH DOES NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME FOR BUYERS TO MEET THEIR BUDGET.

DISPLAYS AND SELECTIONS ARE OUTDATED  - NEEDS TO BE CHANGED"
TAM0614208,Be able to select lot & model ahead of time.(ie. not predetermined by builder) This would allow us to build the home to our exact specifications.
TAM11191004,Many of the optional upgrades are very nice but too expensive
TAM0810111,The home I purchased was an Inventory home listed on the Tamarack Homes website.  It had an occupancy date of July 1st advertised.  When we decided to go through with the purchase we were told that date wouldn't be an option.  We were given a closing date of Aug 25th.  This was an inconvenience due to timing with the sale of our current property.  Other than that the sales and design center process went fairly smooth.
TAM09181001,"More ceramic, wood floor options.   Better standard choices."
TAM0612127,"The design centre is too far from the sales office and where we live, we should have a design centre in every major project.  our design rep Kim was outstanding.
Also, it should be clearly spelled out that HST is added to upgrades and that the $5000 desi"
TAM0713112,"The selection process took us a very long time due to difficulty finding time to visit the design centre. It would have been better to start that process earlier (when we were waiting for the design centre consultation). This pushed out closing date back which wasn't desirable. 

Secondly, when called about our walk through, the inflexibly of times to go through the house wasn't possible for anyone with a job. I was very frustrated to basically be told that I cannot do the walk through because of such rigid times during the day by the site supervisor."
TAM03191000,"When we went to the frame inspection, walls were already closed which totally defeats the purpose.  We were extremely disappointed. For the design centre,  it would be nice to see what the house looks like with all our choices.  A simple computer program does this and many other builders have it.  Pictures of homes with various upgrades at the design centre would be helpful."
TAM08181010,if possible to have the design centre have a rendering of your upgrades before you lock it in
TAM08181030,"More time for design center 
Incorporate software / technology to help visualize designs to simplify decision making at design center"
TAM0315103,More patience at the design centre
TAM0614109,"There needs to be more communication between the sales and design centre. We were told by the sales centre that we could have cable wires moved because we didn't get a chance to have them move because our home was dry walled before we got to the design centre. But at the design centre we were told we couldn't have them moved, or rather they could be moved for a very high fee. Another issue we had was a tile we chose for the tub wall became discontinued but its matching floor tile was not discontinued and we were not allowed to pick a new tub and floor tile. We were only allowed to replace the tub tile. I don't think that is fair because we had to stay with the floor tile and find another wall tile (when the floor and wall came as a match). If I was allowed to pick a new floor and tub tile I would have been okay with that but we weren't. And again this all comes down to communication. Had the design centre had up to date tiles that were labelled ""discontinued"" we would have never chose that matching set. Therefore I think more communication needs to be done. Design centre needs to talk to the sales centre and with the companies they purchase their materials from. As I am still very disappointed with how it was handled."
TAM02201006,Nothing
TAM0516115,nothing. excellent service
TAM09191050,Options to add on minor design changes. Say making the rear deck larger or add a operable window.
TAM10171026,"Follow-up after the upgrade selection to provide cost breakdown of all the options selected and allow time for response. In our case, after our finishes selection, only partial cost of the upgrades was provided. We found out about some of the additional costs of upgrades when the amendment was already prepared. At that point, we also felt rushed to review the amendment. Plus an item was charged twice. Mistakes can happen, but the process can be corrected to verify and approve changes early to eliminate unnecessary misunderstanding. 

Upgrade selection could be more varied for mid price range items, such as cupboard door colours and tiles. 

Provide construction schedule of the house."
TAM06172010,"Design process: 
- I like how it is set up in the model home - Model homes also have nice colour schemes to give customers ideas as well
- I would have liked to have been presented with all the different options - upgrades or not. Felt like I was only shown the standard and didn't really know what other designs, finishes and options were available unless I specifically asked. Try not to assume ""they will just pick the standard"" 
- More guidance on how to outsource things like light fixtures, plumbing faucets for example - I was not given any choices around these options so to date - I still don't know what to expect...
- At times, I felt rushed to make decisions - Important to listen carefully to your customers and be patient - home decisions take time and are very important
Overall - it was a great experience and I would recommend Tamarack and the individuals I worked with - just some little pointers mentioned above"
TAM1213121,"Most of this doesn't apply to us, as this was a quick occupancy home (no design centre process experience)."

TAM05191024,Don’t change out what were standard selections when I signed to upgrades before I have the option to choose. Very unfair. Better selections of standards tiles would be nice. I went directly to the supplier for many selections.

Perhaps  providing  a little more  time or heads up  about the inspection as we had to get it done ASAP  and only had a days notice. In fact were called and asked to go that day!"
TAM0611120,"I was treated wonderfully by everyone in the Findlay creek offices and was very pleased with how quickly and thoroughly they answered my question. I was very disappointed with how we were treated at the design center, the clerk at the desk was very helpful, usuallymuch more so then our design rep. It seemed like if we came during 'browsing' hours she normally ignored us, never asked if we had questions or needed help. Some emails and phone calls I sent were never responded to. There was a form that needed to be signed at the design center and she never bothered to tell either of us and then when we went to the inspection there was a mistake as a result. Most of the upgrades we were interested I had to ask about, she didn't ask me about very much.
 Ewa from muskoka was wonderful and accommodating."
TAM1111141,"The process was great, we were constantly informed, and had all questions answered."
TAM0313116,the upgrade catalogue is too extensive they should redused the number of upgrade and/or do maybe package of upgrade
TAM0216104,add bath to the basement.
TAM09171024,"What I would change?-before signing a purchase agreement, to have clearly conveyed the 'extras' in great detail. We were told EVERYTHING was included. Everything. Everything. Everything. It is not. We didn't pick one standard item for our home and it would have really changed how we went about purchasing our home.  The process was very discouraging and every time we turned around it was an added cost. I was the disigner  for a builder, so I understand things cost money. But it would have been nice to know before purchasing agreements came out. We were told very little and coming from two home buyers that are in this exact field we were very disappointed with the process."
TAM0415102,"Less confusion from Tamarack. Explain the process in detail for an ""inventory home"" (i.e. explain the milestones specifically for inventory home as difference from a home being constructed). It was not explained to us that we had less time than what was in contract to make our selections (give us a precise date).

Bilingual service (i.e. french) for overview of Agreement of Purchase and sale."
TAM0710108,"1. Need more time for the design center.
2. No delay in closing date."
TAM04182009,More physical examples of some things at the design center.
TAM0211109,"We would change the kitchen designer from Muskoka who made the process complicated and stressfull, with little help in the design (we had to figure out all the details for the best configuration for our kitchen ourselves). She kept changing things that we agreed upon and we had to always double check mesurements and specs to ensure that it stayed the way we first agreed upon. Stressful process."
TAM1210101,"It would have been nice to see a model home  similar  to the one we bought and decorated more to the style of seniors. 
The design centre was most accommodating and we appreciate the time both Christine and Chantelle gave us. They were most helful and pleasant.Also, Tamarack  offered a wide range of choices and quality  of upgrades which we appreciated. Hopefuly, the building process will be as professional."
TAM0614206,"Nothing, I am really happy if the service! They are great!"
TAM01181001,Morgan Will be gone...useless for me.
TAM0717105,Have another location for people in Toronto or better accommodation for them.
TAM0614212,She said this is a model home:design questions I rated 7   She just got the keys today for the house.
TAM0910129,N/a
TAM0213121,"Overall everything to date has been terrific.  We absolutely love dealing with Jacqui Collier (Woodhaven in Kingston, ON).  She answers our questions promptly and accurately, she always returns our calls immediately and she is honest with us.  Jacqui's skills and personality  are what sold us on a Tamarack Home.  We had been to several other builders in the Kingston area and nobody has representation like Tamarack does with Jacqui.  As first time homebuyers it was important to us to feel we could trust the builder.  We didn't get a trustworthy feeling from any other builder (new homes) or even when we briefly looked at resale with realtors in Kingston.  Jacqui is the reason why we bought a Tamarack home.

Walk-Through:
I wasn't aware that we could note deficiencies in the Walk-Through process with the site super.  If I knew that I was supposed to be looking for deficiencies, I might have taken a closer look or pointed a couple of things out.  We still enjoyed our walk through with Mike.  he is extremely knowledgeable and was very friendly with us.  We are glad to know that someone with Mike's experience and perosnality is overseeing the construction of our first home.  

It was great to learn that Mike and Jacqui both own their own Tamarack homes as well.  This made me trust Tamarack even more.

Interiors:
The interiors selection process was a little bit overwhelming at times.  Granted there are a lot of decisions to be made, we felt that the process was a bit disorganized.  We would have liked to know how much various options cost as an input into our selections.  For example, it would have been more efficient when choosing our countertops to compare various options with respect to cost. Since we already know the counter in our model home is 'x' square feet, it is likely possible to provide us with an approximate cost per square foot for 'y' style marble with 'z' style of edge?  Going back and forth for quotes and comparing what was available in the show room vs. in vendor's storefronts was a bit painful.

We were also a bit unclear about the process for purchasing faucets and sinks.  We went to a local store which we thought was the supplier to Tamarack (just like we went to the tile store for tile/flooring and the counter store for granite).  After several visits to the faucets/sink store and requesting quotes on products, we learned that they were not the Tamarack supplier and the cost of buying the exact same faucets/sinks were higher through Tamarack due to shipping costs.  This was a bit disappointing because we could have just bought the exact same faucet and sinks for much cheaper (almost half price) a few blocks from our new house.

We had a bit of an issue with our hardwood price.  Tamarack forgot that we had selected hardwood for the hallway in our second floor.  They realized this with only a couple of days left to finalize our interiors which really impacted our budget.  At the last minute we had to cancel other interior selections which we had already spent hours deciding upon.  A bit frustrating, but we consider ourselves reasonable people and got over it.

We were a bit surprised when we received our initial kitchen drawings back from Muskoka.  They forgot about an 18” by  10” (approx.) wall that sticks out from the back-centre of our house into the kitchen (a supporting wall that separates the kitchen from the family room).  It wasn’t until I pointed this out to Tamarack that the mistake was caught and fixed.  Good thing we caught this otherwise we would have had only a foot and a couple of inches of clearance to walk between that wall and our kitchen island.

As mentioned above, our overall experience has been great.  Any time we have had any issues, unanswered questions, etc. Jacqui has been there to reassure us.  She was and will continue to be the reason why we chose Tamarack."
TAM0812135,I want more time with designer to decide my upgrade options and design ideas.
TAM0809105,"i was not impressed that it took so long to get a closing date, there was not compensation for it, also Tamarak made changes to the home when they needed to but after 2 days after completing our interior selection i could not change our hard wood width, there was no flexibility."
TAM1115109,"The sales reps should know better than to offer upgrades that they aren't allowed to offer. In my case, it was a free walk in shower that ended up costing nearly $2000."
TAM0912105,"I would have liked to go to desing center in more then one time, it is very overwhelming to choose every thing in one metting."
TAM0317106,"We would have appreciate a design center team who were transparent and honest about the upgrade choices. There was a lot of confusion and back and forth about what was being charged and why without a valid explanation outlining why certain upgrades cost what they did.  Further, we only became aware of some options after we had signed off our design center paperwork.  In a nutshell, the initial sales experience was outstanding - the design center experience was abysmal."
TAM0614112,"The sales rep (the 1st one) who helped us thru the purchase was great! The site manager, we did not like him he was abrupt, he needed to be more personable - he was like doom and gloom."
TAM1209116,Better color selection for standards although we have heard that the design centre in ottawa is better than the options in kingston.
TAM10191044,No change
TAM1112100,"I would like a buyer has a say interior design & the upgrade, so he or she can make change with 0$."
TAM10171027,I think the sales and design process is being managed very well
TAM0912126,Her son took care of most of it because her health hasn't been great.
TAM0512115,An additional meeting with the design rep would be beneficial prior to finalizing design choices.
TAM0816128,Any demonstration with 3D interior design and renderings functionality would be very good and efficient for customer self design.
TAM0710112,"The Tamarack consultant should have blue prints of the home with detailed electrical and structural drawing for review by clients as we (clients) make decisions about electical, fireplace, heating and cooling upgrades. 
Some suppliers vere very helpful, ex Boone plumbing, tile Euro, Cerated while Westboro was not at all and didn`t return calls."
TAM05191017,I am very disappointment with the multiple extension of closing date.   Most disappointment with lack of communication and knowledge with progression of the home.  No one seems to know what is going on and with no answers.
TAM1216113,More time to make design decisions. It was overwhelming how many options were available.
TAM02171006,"Everything was perfect,this is our 3rd home for us and my 2others daughters have also bought a Tamarack home,and we have high praise.Off the record we have bought a bungalow  that Tamarack is building and we are so pleased with their progress as time is a big factor for us due to the nature of my husband illness."
TAM0914113,"With a small child and both adults working full-time, we found it difficult to find the time to come to the design centre to make our selections and felt rushed during the process.  If we had had more than 45 days for design centre selections or if the design centre was open earlier/later it would have been helpful.  Also, we felt a bit misled regarding some of the pricing and would have appreciated more guidance on credits and final taxes on the interior selections.  We had to make a number of requests for explanations on breakdown of costs for our kitchen and tiling installations so we could determine which choices to make to stay within our budget as our quotes were provided as a total for the whole job.  A clearer breakdown of costs would have been appreciated and would have made it easier for us to make our selections."
TAM0715102,"The design center process was great but we were not confident that our sales agent was fully knowledgeable regarding the options available, ie. was unsure if front door had full or half glass, no or limited info. about the garage door, unsure about size of back yard(turns out it was bigger that we first thought). Overall the sales and design staff were very easy and professional to deal with. Looking forward to our move into a Tamarack home. Hopefully the walking & bike paths will be as described in the advertising & that the bridge over the creek will be installed sooner that later. Phase one is a very attractive location with many level changes and great views."
TAM09191034,The design centre process should be changed. My experience was very bad. There were a lot of selections to be made and there was no system in place to know item by item list of what the standards are and what upgrades are available. There should be a checklist made available to the customer to decide and document as they are going through. the designer made notes in her file and sent the final upgrade list more than a month later and I don't remember what I discussed by then. I am terribly put off by the design center experience
TAM09191025,No change to sales or design center process.
TAM0315101,"Having better communication between the sales office and design center. As well as assuring that staff have all the knowledge about every home wether it is. New to them or not, it will give the buyers less of a headache."
TAM1011118,"I went to the design center several times to pre select almost all of our choices because leaving things up in the air to choose in 3 hours would have sent me up the wall. Kim was fabulous in helping us finalize our choices, make decisions about style and she was very knowlegeable. It ended up being a fantastic appointment thanks to her efficiency and knowledge but I was quite concerned about it because I felt that we were on a tight schedule. My anal retantiveness and shared perfectionism with Kim made it a successful appointment but for others, I would emphasize the need to pre select and perhaps allocate more time or split the appointment up to give people more time to reflect because it felt rushed (but not by Kim in any way, she was SO outstandingly effecient and confident). Also very pleased at how much time and care was shown to us by Richard your Site supervisor. Working out a brick issue right now that I fully trust he will resolve."
TAM0614107,"When I bought the home I was told I could do all the upgrades I wanted.  Unfortunately construction had already started which caused some difficulties.  At my first appointment at the design centre, the consultant gave me the option of having the ensuite shower tiled, amongst other things.  I subsequently found out that the fiberglass shower had already been installed.  I was told that I would have to pay $4,000 to have the fiberglass stall removed.  I was not willing to pay that exhorbitant cost due to someone's lack of communication.  It was subsequently resolved but took some time."
TAM1114104,Everything was organized and well done. No complaints.
TAM0615124,Did not have to deal with design centre
TAM0811120,Maybe more direct one-on-one when fully customizing some aspect of the house - i.e. custom kitchen design and function.
TAM0911120,"At first, I did not wish to bother you with these thoughts as often in large companies, one can only wounder who pays attention to these comments.  But this story need to be told as I am still offended about the service I received at the time of purchase, a year ago.

Let me explain.

I would definitely change the initial purchase phase.  It must be said that I was the tenth person in line for the second phase of the Tamarack Series.  This being said, I began 'camping' on the step of the sales office in the early hours of the Wednesday morning with several other enthusiastic buyers.  By 7pm that evening, the office had decided to give out priority numbers as they did not want any of their costumers to sleep on their porch.  This being said, I was the tenth person in line, therefore, secured number ten, or yet again, secured my name on the bungalow-towns purchase list.  I was then advise to return on the Friday morning as the purchases would begin at 10am.

Never the less, As I returned to the sales office at approx. 8am on Friday morning, I noticed that approx. 60 individuals had also attended the Office in an attempt to purchase a house.  Then to my great surprise, I was told to wait for several hours as the Office decided to sale the lots by way of reservation and not by way of priority.  They began deciding to sale the large single lots first, moved into the bungalows, then semis and so on, selling the units by category.  This truly and still insulted me as I lost my tenth position in line, thinking that I would be the tenth person to secure a lot. 

By the Friday, I had decided that I wanted to purchase a semi detach bungalow instead of of a town but as the sale office did not respect the priority numbers, I was only left with the bungalow town and never had the opportunity to purchase the lot that I wanted.  Further more, that morning, as my frustration grew towards the situation, I decided to enquirer about the priority numbers at the office, when I heard the sales person indicate that they are no longer calling individuals as they had 'lost control' of the situation and stated:'just get me four other person, anyone'.  Thankfully, I was beside them when one stated this as I immediately advised them of my frustration and that I would now be one of the four 'next' purchasers.  Even with these actions, I could not pick the initial lot that I wanted, after getting in line three days earlier and obtaining a number as I counted 22 dots of the site map.  First come, first serve is very important to me and it was disgustingly not the case during the purchase time.

I was very close to leaving the site that morning refusing to buy from your company.

Further more, at the sale center, I do have to mention that we were pressured by time.  Thankfully we had attended the center multiple times prior to our appointments but did not like being pushed out of our appointment because it took more time then the time allowed.  At the end we are purchasing a 300 000$ property and would like to be treated with respect as customers.

In conclusion, I am so far satisfied with the product but the service and the ultimate frustration at the time of purchase are still in my thoughts.

Thank you for your time
Respecfuly"
TAM0816106,It might be a good idea to have a check list for the sale of the house (structural) and an understanding on what needs to be decided on the spot while you buy a house.  I would of liked to have an appointment with Miskoka but got told it was not necessary at first.  I think it would have been.  It might be a good idea to separate the choice of colors possibly in 2 appointments.  It was hard to do in only 3 hours.  Also when I had a meeting the same morning to do the electrical....   It might be a good idea to explain to the purchaser what it implies when they purchase wood stairs and have to decide right away maple or oak and not see the difference.  I would of preferd maple floors for house after seeing the choice of stains and wideness of the floor boards but had to stick with oak because of my stairs that could not get changed.  I was hoping for a wider floor board.  I am a bit disappointed to not have been contacted for the framing walk-thru.  I am also wondering if there is any possibility that my house might be ready earlier than August 17th.  I am in the process of a seperation and was hoping for the possibility to move beginning of August.
TAM04171018,Have clearer answers about possible changes to the home. We understand that it may take time to consult with the builders but it should not have taken months - literally - to answer some of our questions.
TAM0615116,"-- More clear communication from the ladies in the sales centre on the following: 
- We were told that our townhome had a rough-in for a washroom in the basement by the ladies in the sales centre. At our frame check, we were informed that this was not true.
- When we put a hold on the lot, we were told that our outside brick colour would be light grey (because we weren't able to choose the colour). But we can see now that the colour is slightly different. 

-- We had a AWFUL experience at The Brick. We would highly recommend changing the contact person or changing the company that purchasers have to go through to use the appliance bonus. Luckily, Mandy Mason at the Design Centre addressed our concerns when we told her about them. If it weren't for her, we don't know how we would have enjoyed the process at all. 
- Some details with regard to the poor client service/experience we dealt with at the Brick (West Hunt Club) for our Bonus Program: 
- As we already told Mandy at our sign off at the Design Centre, the whole experience was stressful and unpleasant. Here are some specific examples:
- The biggest issue is that Andrew Main insisted that we must pay for all the appliances we purchase in full to secure them (saying it's the Brick's policy). The problem with this is that no other furniture or appliance store does this (usually it's a deposit and then cash on delivery or just prior to delivery). Also, he did not guarantee that we would get the appliances for the prices that we purchased them for (i.e. if the price of the appliances drop - he said 'he doesn't have to respect the lower price', and if an appliance gets discontinued - he said 'it would be our problem and we would need to select the replacement piece or another model which may be more in price').
- He also had a 'it's not my problem, it's yours' attitude and would say things that made us just not want to deal with him ever again. Like 'well I get the money from Tamarack either way so it's up to you to do what you want to do'. He also asked us to send him info over e-mail so he could prepare pricing for us for when we met ... Every time we went to see him, he had nothing prepared and we had to sit with him while he looked up the pricing for each piece (turning a 30 minute scheduled appointment into an hour and 15 minutes).
- When we first tried to contact Andrew at the beginning of September to just get the starting information, he did not return our voicemails (2) and e-mails. We ended up going in on the weekend and talking to his colleague who is a Rep. for other builders and she nicely walked us through the appliance section and gave us the basic info she knew about. She left a note for Andrew on his desk since he hadn't gotten back to us and he ended up getting back to us a week later...When we first met him, he told us he didn't have much information for us besides the fact that the basic package was pretty low-end so he recommended opting for the bonus amount. But he said it was our responsibility to research the appliances and just send him the product codes (which was opposite to what the ladies at the Sales Center said - we were told he would help guide us).
- Another major issue we have is scheduling. He only works Monday to Friday from 8-4p.m. (with no flexibility) so we had to rush over on our lunch breaks or right after work to get time with him. Most client based places (like the Design Centre) have a few other evening or weekend options.

-- In all honestly, besides the time that we had to deal with Andrew Main, we have enjoyed the process so far. We also REALLY want to highlight how AMAZING Mandy Mason was with us. So helpful, kind, informative - and she's the one that corrected the whole issue with The Brick (especially because we weren't her only clients experiencing the same issues with him). Carla Mason has been very helpful as well - so prompt at getting back to us when we need confirmation of information as we approach our closing date."
TAM09191007,Free items such as a coffee maker or vacuum or tv...
TAM1115112,"Nothing,they were very helpful at the design centre.

I've got to say that Marg at the sales centre made the whole process of buying the house so pleasant. Very knowledgeable, and a beautiful woman inside out."
TAM0612135,No comment
TAM09181035,I was very disappointed that my realtor who had traveled with me to Ottawa did not get commission for the sale. I was not aware that the sign in sheet would be used against me when I came in with a Realtor.
TAM03182034,"Although this may be difficult it would be nice to know placement of fences, underground utilities that may restrict use of part of property and why certain lots do not include at least one tree."
TAM10191051,Nothing
TAM0213110,"The choices of the upgrade needs more than those days you have proposed
special the first one needs to split in two."
TAM1115106,Design center should be more computerized for the hundred of options selection....would make it faster for the designer and more easily reviewable for the customers
TAM1012113,"In design centre, have more affordable choices in term of price and selections.
For the high end models, include more choices and style as basic. Everything is upgrade."
TAM1216109,"Two things:

1. We became aware at a late stage that we could have negotiated the design centre bonus of 5K to 10k which Tamarack had previously offered, so if we could, we would re-negotiate that. 

2. We would also re-negotiate the 10k lot premium. Looking at the thin line of trees in the back of the lot where our home is being build, we feel the 10k premiums is too high for what we are getting (we were expecting more privacy and more lush trees in the back)."
TAM0511104,"-We would like to have the information available in both official languages of Canada.  It will be ideal to have in each sale centre at least one bilingual person.

-Increase the amount of money for ugrades."
TAM0615132,"We had an amazing experience from the sales and design centers. I personally found it a little hard to visualize the upgrade options, and wished a computerized display was available, if even just the big things like floor and cabinets. The staff is so knowledgeable and helpful, it did make it easier."
TAM0712105,"I'm happy with the services provided by the sales rep and the design centre 
They are all very understanding and cooperative and are ready to understand and help whenever required . 

 Thank you tamarack for being a great builder."
TAM0611117,To be told you have to go to all the different stores to pick out your finishes. We thought we could do more of that at the model home. Just being informed of that would have been nice.
TAM06161014,"We were very happy with the sales process, however it would be great if the design centre would be able to be more clear with the options available, including pricing, and to have options for visualising the house with the upgrades chosen eg. a computer program. We were given a price list that had inaccurate information, and because of that and our time constraint we didn't do some upgrades we had been discussing. However, we are so far (without seeing the house yet!) happy with the design choices we made and we did not feel pressured to choose something we didn't want."
TAM06171025,More time at the design centre and provided with more information regarding upgrades.
TAM1012126,Happy with both.
TAM0816137,Nothing!
TAM0910101,"Advertising fake-Indicates many upgrades. Standard choices are horrible so need to upgrade almost everything.  You offered $5000.00 sign-on bonus but then you took $500.00 tax.  Be upfront about reality you offer $5000-you suck up the tax. You over charge so so much.  To me the upgrades are a money grab.  $500 for an upgraded sink faucet when the company price was $250.00 is ludicrous.  The trades are 'pigs' cups, pop cans in the walls & my new tubs (keep covers over the tubs) A mess!
Refer to question:
1. Properly greeted me when I entered the office: a bit elitist.
3.  Coffee cups in walls, lots of saw dust, tradesperson smoking in my home (while installing insulation)  The siding already falling off the house."
TAM0514105,"Just some minor inconveniences:
- The Design Centre was not always aware of some upgrades no longer being available.  So we would make our selections, then had to go back to the Design centre and select another upgrade.
- The Design Centre was not always aware of some upgrades being compatable with other upgrades. For example, an upgraded sink was not campatable with an upgraded faucet. Again we would have to return to the Design Centre to choose another upgrade."
TAM07191013,"1. I think that final costs of all upgrades etc should be provided in advance of the final sign off meeting. Had i had these costs in advance, I would have made additional upgrades, unfortunately at 8pm on the night of  my sign of meeting i was presented with the costing and only then realized i had a lot more room for upgrades etc. but by then it was too late."
TAM1211114,"A one-page, summarized milestone checklist to guide the buyer through the purchase process, that they receive before hand.
Also, clearer documentation (final summary of all upgrades agreed to with total cost) promptly provided, rather than handwriting on the purchase summary."
TAM1116111,Online selection
TAM0910118,"Informing clients that they should come in before their scheduled appointments at the design centre to browse (we went in on our own simply for our own piece of mind...we were told that we didn't need to until our appointment, but the extra browing time definitely helped us feel more confident with our options)."
TAM1015110,"We are disappointed that we are not giving credits when not taking standard options. i.e. We do not want the mantle, surround or hearth for the upstairs fireplace and are being given a credit for that cost. Overall, the Tamarack experience has been very good so far."
TAM1216107,"Sales centre : the upgrades included in model homes should have a price associated to them on the specifications sheet. The upgrades done in the model homes are not always obvious based on the description of the specification sheet. 

Design centre : We would have liked to have more time to get advice from the consultant on design choices.(additional meeting might have been good)

Frame check : we have identified some deficiencies in the home but the site supervisor did not provide us with the opportunity to see if the deficiencies were repaired in the home.(the foam sheets had huge cracks between them or holes, some ducks were folded shut or flasher tape was cut through, the water line coming inside the home did not seem secure. We had some questions for the site supervisor and he is presently not returning my calls. Also, the available hours to have the frame check done were not convenient for us (mornings only)."
TAM08181006,"Communication! It seemed that no one was on the same page regarding timing, appointments etc. example) Concept homes refused to acknowledge that I attended their meeting until I showed pictures of the contract I signed in their building. 

Issues like being ""strongly recommended"" a counter depth fridge because the door will hit the island, and not offering any counter depth fridges in the upgrades was ridiculous. 

Leg work for calling and communicating with others from Tamarack team was often placed on me the buyer. 

My house closing date was pushed back because design centre process took too long, when upon purchase I was told that if I met the instructed dates, the house would be available on time. I purchased the house with that promise, made every meeting on time, and still this was an issue. Design centre contracts had multiple mistakes and changes in them from what I had picked at the time of signing. If I was careless and just signed, my home would be completely different.

Overall communication was terrible, often I would be re-explaining or redoing a process multiple times to multiple people to get everyone on the same page myself. Home buying with Tamarack has unfortunately been a very painful process. No compensation, or solutions were found to many of my issues ex) I am now paying for a fridge that does not fit the unit. I will have to buy a new fridge somewhere else, only to gift or sell the one I am forcefully purchasing with Tamarack. Muskoka was looking to redesign my kitchen to accommodate at my financial expense because of the door issue. None of this was explained or mentioned before I had already signed.

Furthermore, despite these issues not being fixed yet. I am continued to be asked for more and more deposits.

Overall, I had originally planned to buy multiple investment homes in the new Findlay Creek area, but this home buying experience has truly made me consider going with other companies for my upcoming purchases."
TAM0317104,It was problem free.
TAM0214102,"I would have liked to see the standard plumbing clearly illustrated in the design centre.  I still have no idea of the faucet that will be placed in my four bathroom sinks.  I will know when I move in.  The faucet was described, but a visual replica would have been appreciated."
TAM0416104,Better understanding of deadlines/timelines for design/upgrades to be determined.
TAM0911108,"We were not entirely happy with the kitchen design process.  We felt that Gayle at Muskoka did not really present options or ideas, just tried to design a simple rectangle island and it took a lot of effort to get her to draw the island we envisioned."
TAM0113110,provide construction updates when major tasks are completed.
TAM0909125,"Better communication between design centre, implications of timeline and impact on build schedule with head office.  In my case, my closing date was delayed without any indication that I had exceeded a milestone, thereby giving neither the design centre nor myself any opportunities to ensure that we had completed the final design within schedule.  In the end I believe things worked out well, but it indicated that some improvements could be made during the communication process."
TAM11191022,"Just a note, we did not need to go through the designing processes. Thus, we answered all 5s. Wish there was a N/A button."
TAM01171008,"I should be educated more about the difference between model home and the home that i am buying, like i missed to note that the side light is missing and door is full glass in new design which i over looked and later came as a surprise to me. For design centre, the person should be more knowledgable, like she missed to educate me that garage door is not part of interior door package, i upgraded all my indoor to smooth finish and came as a surprise during frame walk through."
TAM0711113,"The biggest thing that I would change in the design process is the kitchen manufacturer. It was extremely difficult and at times frustrating not being able to go into a local kitchen place and directly speak with reps.  I have used a local company when building my first house and it offered way more selection and restructuring based upon measurements.  I was able to get professional advice, I was expecting that when designing my kitchen with Tamarack, however this was not the case and it was just a series of unexplained emails between Muskoka and Tamarack. Your reps did as best they could with the situation however I still feel like I would have benefited more from walking into a local manufacturer and getting face to face time."
TAM0715118,"Muskoka rep was not very knowledgable or helpful.  The options catalogue should be online, with pictures, and with better descriptions."
TAM0710127,"Document possible/potential upgrades to homes, so people would know what to ask/upgrade. This would be extremely useful.

Mention pros and cons of not having or having certain features in the new home. Example hot water tank and this new device that is in place instead, which I've been told rent is more expensive and  shows some inconviniences.

Finally provide more orientation in terms and friendly environment in regards to kitchens upgrades"
TAM10191032,"we were very disappointed that the house was delayed. we had gone with Tamarack as a builder for their reputation of not delaying the build, so we were disappointed when the house was delayed."
TAM0214107,I wish I had someone more experienced from the design center to help me.
TAM0909114,"Nothing, experience was very smooth"
TAM1211111,"Allow more time for the final appointment where a customer signs off.  This is the final meeting, after which changes cannot be made, and should not be rushed."
TAM07181010,When establishing a budget its crucisl to know estimayrs for bug ticket items.  I wasnt provided estimates for some items until a day before the last final meeting.  The estimate for my biggest item was one i continued to ask about since day 1 and nobody could assist with any form of an estimate.
TAM0714114,have discounts for hitting specified dollar levels at the design centre. the more you spend the bigger the discount
TAM0916109,I would educate her more than she is.  She must be better than this.  She should try to have knowledge of what she is selling.  She didn't give us a chance to read.  There is no solution.  You guys are getting the money and we end up with no solutions.  We are suffering.
TAM1116110,"Would like the ability to enter the home under construction with a representative more often than just at the pre set walk throughs, only 2 during the entire construction offered to us."
TAM0613104,Cannot speak highly enough of all involved. Wouldn't change anything!
TAM1013132,"The process works well, nothing to change. Just wish the design centre was closer to the sales centre."
TAM10171025,"Be more receptive to clients ideas for customizing their home, be realistic in costing your upgrades - we can all use the internet to see what items are priced at elsewhere!"
TAM0310103,"I have a suggestions. How feasible to provide this is questionable.
TO provide take home samples of such things as flooring, paint selections.
I did receive counter top samples but it would facilitate shopping for furniture to have all of the choices as samples.

I would have liked to have a model of the home I purchased to get a visual idea of what it will look like. Failing that, to have a chance to walk through an already sold but empty home."
TAM07191028,n/a
TAM08191019,Nothing to be change
TAM08191035,"For second appointment with design center, I found that 2.5 hours  is not enough if it is your first time to buy a new house ."
TAM11191008,Can’t think of anything.
TAM0111103,"1) We had a couple problems with our home during the construction phase that we feel should have been addressed differently. 2) We had to attend Tamarack several times to sign amendments to our purchase sale because mistakes were continuously made.
-We know that our house is going to be beautiful but I was very disappointed with the entire process.  We would not recommend Tamarack to friends or family because everytime we attempted to address our concerns we were ingnored and pushed aside. 
-The only people we were impressed with were the people we dealt with at Grants Tile."
TAM0910106,the prices for the upgrades are EXTREMELY inflated; disgusting in fact
TAM1016126,"It would be nice to be able to review options and design elements online, it's probably something more millennial like myself will come to expect but being given a paper options document and then having to google or ask when going into the design centre was less then ideal for us.

An example would be like buying a product from Apple, options are detailed and can be view / reviewed online"
TAM0812136,"""The design center should be computerized. We should know the price and total right the way. Not enough selection in design center and we have to run around to different stores to see the options - wasting time.  Some options are too expensive. I hate to use the word 'ridiculous' to describe. Upgrading the rail of a staircase costs over $8000.00 + tax.

In the basement, the air duct is in front of the window. It gives me hard time to install the ceiling. This design doesn't make any sense."""
TAM0210114,I was throughouly impresed throughout the entire process.  Kim at the design centre was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful.
TAM0510113,"Sales:
1) Would be very useful if sales person pointed out certain upgrades were structural changes and had to be done prior to design center. Some things we wanted to have done was too late.

Designer center:
1) Lack of time to make decsions to due to inefficient process of getting estimate upgrade costs. I don't understand why it takes such a long time when there is a limited period for home owners to get through the full process. I would recommend either adding help or start the design center process earlier so home owners will have the time to make their decisions as a home purchase is a big investment and cost.

2) Poor communication between kitchen designer at Muskoka and Tamarack designer. 
3) Poor selection of intermediate level upgrades (eg. tiles). Most were either standard or two level or higher ugrades.
4) Not enough designers leading to late appointments to finalize selections which forced our closing date out a month and we were blamed for the delay by head office."
TAM02182008,Just the location but I don't think that could change.
TAM10171024,Get wooden stairs
TAM0213108,nothing
TAM0614218,"Design center process should be change. Right now very difficult to
take decision in term of pricing procedure during selection. Thank you"
TAM06161017,They laid out everything really well and colour coded it so everything went well.  The only thing is that everything I liked was an upgrade and I got a lot of upgrades.
TAM0214109,More selections
TAM01181004,"Experience with the different suppliers during summer time was sometimes difficult. Hardly available, didn't return calls or answers to our questions. Very few samples of upgrades were made available, even at their stores or warehouses.

Also wish that the design center could physically show all the standard features (ex. lighting fixtures, tubs, faucets, etc.)

We really appreciated working with Joy Kerr and Mandy Mason, both very nice persons. We never felt pushed by them at any time, and both were always calm and understanding throughout the process."
TAM1212118,"Design Centre experience was a little confusing.
Misunderstanding on a few things.  It did get resolved."
TAM06171008,they have two suppliers that do the hard wood.  We loved the hardwood floor that was offered by the other supplier and it was in the model home but we couldn't have it because we were buying in this one particular neighbourhood.  It basically took me looking through all the other hardwood choices to choose another one.  I felt that it was unfair that all the other Tamarack communities could have this particular hardwood but we couldn't just because of this one community.
TAM0713111,"Our initial date for all design related decisions was April 11, not an issue as we had everything selected before that date but when we finally received the signed copies (from Ottawa) we noticed that date had been changed to April 1st.
We were not informed of any changes and this could have potentially been an issue."
TAM10191004,"Have a better calendar of walk through our new house because nothing was plan we had to ask to get the opportunity to visit. Every time we went the place was with garbage ( bottles, scrap food paper, ) other than construction.
We also would need to access the percentage of avancement of the construction to be able to work with our bank.
Having an internet account about what concern our new house would be a way to access and refer for any of our concern."
TAM0113102,"It would have been nice to have brought it to our attention regarding the bell box on front lawn.  It's an eye sore.  We would have still bought the house but, wish we had of known."
TAM0615133,"The time period it takes to get into a Tamarack home. The earliest close we could get was 7 months from purchase, which is longer than other builders."
TAM0712124,"Would have liked to find a better way to get prices rather than request by email (takes longer)  like a referral chart.  For purachsers who have never been part of the building process before, it would help if there was a tutorial or optional meeting to become more familiar with the process and timelines for each stage of selections and building process.  At one point I thought that we had 45 day to submit our list of upgrade selections, but ended up being the final signing.  It worked out in the end but is an important detail to know in advance."
TAM0712112,"It seemed very rushed in the time line. I was given 2 weeks between my initial meeting and the finialization of my choices. 
also, a quote was asked for some times and was forgotten about , that mistake was caught by head office and i ended up not getting the backsplash because of the mistake and time frame given to make a new choice."
TAM07191011,NA
TAM1013135,"design center is too far away from each community, takes too much time on each appt"
TAM03182000,"I would like to have been given a ""ruff in"" upgrade for the basement."
TAM0513112,1. give buyer catalog about different design option and price.
TAM0313113,"Ann was the first point of contact and was not knowledgeable and differed our questions completely.  We were however happy with the pricing and look of the homes and still purchased.  We had further administrative problems, missed/errors in paperwork on two separate occasions. Changes and confusion regarding scheduled appointments. Called to book something with us and then later realized they had pulled the wrong file after we had made daycare arrangements.  We feel that the administrative process was very disorganized and unprofessional.
Our design centre experience was the best part.  Christine was amazing to work with, very knowledgeable, personable and professional."
TAM0310110,Note - I didn't have a blue print meeting.
TAM0411112,"Sale person must be more clear and specific about the models, and go through the details instead of calculatiing how much their comission will be on this house. I used to think that TAMARAk was a better compnay compare to other builder but I was obviously wrong."
TAM0113111,"Ensure upgrade sheets are updated as items in the design center did not adhere to the upgrade sheets (where items were listed as ""included, $0.00"", we were told they were not included and had a fee).

We had an appointment with the sales representative and waited over an hour for her to finish up with the clients beforehand even though we had an appointment. Do not book back to back appointments or adhere to committed schedule as per Tamarack's booking."
TAM10191028,Offer more choices in the builders standard options selections.  Upgrades can add a lot of costs  in the already costly venture of buying a home.
TAM0910121,We felt the design center could have been a better experience for new home buyers.  More help chosing designs and more one on one time with designers.
TAM08171018,"Our main issue is that the sales centre never properly communicated with the design centre what clients could and could not do until after designs were chosen. The design representatives should be well aware of changes in policy and design limitations. We would be told one thing by the design centre and then have that refuted by the sales centre later on, which meant our customization expectations weren't met. It was a headache to have to fight for the things we were told we could have. 
 
For instance, 1) we were initially told by the design centre that we could pay to have the ensuite shower tiled, but had that option revoked; 2) we wanted all standard plumbing but were told after we signed the upgrades list that our choice of double sinks in the ensuite bathroom would need sink upgrades; 3) we were told we could change out a full glass exterior door that isn't conducive to privacy for a windowless one, but were told by the sales centre that our contract clearly indicated that this wasn’t changeable. We understood that the selections listed in the contract were pre-installed because we were late to the party with our purchase, but that we could change them if we were willing to pay for it. 
 
We also felt that we had to be our own project manager for this experience, from the home theatre people to the cabinetry people. We signed multiple amendments to the final upgrades list because our specifications were always a bit off each time they were presented to us. This was unnecessarily stressful. We're still waiting on the last signed amendments with the final cost to send to our mortgage broker. These should have been signed by the builder and sent to us already, as our last signed amendment was sent May 16, 2017. 
 
Based on this experience, we're wary to recommend a new Tamarack home to others. It remains to be seen whether the quality of the build meets our expectations. We truly hope what we went through is the exception to the rule.  

We will say that, through it all, Morgan Champagne tried hard to ensure all our concerns were addressed, and answered every question we had promptly, whether by email or phone. I can't fault her for the miscommunication between all the different areas. We truly felt supported by her despite the various setbacks."
TAM1215101,"We would have liked to be given credits for items not used (carpet, etc). Also, although we spent a lot of money on upgrades, we would have spent a lot more if the costs passed on to us weren't so expensive (cost is more than triple than if we buy it ourselves; toilets, shower heads, etc)."
TAM0512101,more standard finishings in the models
TAM0317101,Give more choices in the standard options
TAM06161019,"We are not impressed by Carolyn Hawkes, Design Coordinator. She was unprepared for our first meeting and did not provide us with enough information to make our selections. The design center was not ready and we had a difficult time going through our options. Carolyn did not show any urgency and took days to reply to our emails. Lastly, she did not forward us the pricing estimates promptly and we had to rush through at the very end to meet our deadline. In the whole process of buying a Tamarack Home, the design process was a complete disappointment."
TAM0510104,"The design centre staff were extremely friendly and welcoming however overall they seemed too busy.  Although our consultant was excellent, I didn't feel like she had the time to help with the choices as much as I would have liked, but overall it was a good experience just feel that there could have been more time allotted to the meetings.  

The kitchen design process was a little difficult and very rushed.  At times, I felt like I was a nuisance to the designer, but to give her the benifit of the doubt, she did seem to have a heavy load on her plate."
TAM0811122,"Sales rep was fantastic - knowledgeable, patient, professional, even under the handicap of having to explain our occupancy being delayed so often. However, one big negative for us was the excessive delay (8 months) between the down payment and Tamarack's obtaining of the building permit for our home, from the city. This was followed by two more notices of delay of occupancy of our home. From Design Centre selections to occupancy of our home will be approx. ONE YEAR!! And the notices of dalay made it very difficulot to offer our current home for sale with a firm occupancy date."
TAM0211122,"I think that we got in to this house a little late and they had already closed up the walls not allowing us to have pot lights. We were told when we purchased the home that it would not be a problem to later find out it was.

Also I marked '1' on the survey for walk through because we haven't moved in yet."
TAM0612134,More time for design centre selection
TAM0711110,"it was really well organized.
staff was helpful and courteous."
TAM0511128,"The process is very streamlined and both Jaqueline & Carolyn are very knowledgeable. 

The only thing we would modify perhaps, is one step during the design centre process related to the kitchen. There were a few pages of 'upgrades' that seemed unnecessary i.e. asking if we wanted plastic utensil liners for our drawers or garbage bins under the sink. When you're purchasing a new home that is comparatively more expensive than other builders in the area (rightfully so), it seems odd to go through sheets containing multiple items priced in the $30-$100 range. While we felt no pressure whatsoever from the salesperson to purchase these items, that was the only time it actually felt like Tamarack was in the business of making a profit from their customers."
TAM0614116,The design to have more available hours (evenings) we work during the day. The time they had on the door (saying open) they were closed.
TAM0412110,"If I could change anything about the process it would be not getting straight answers to questions that were posed.  When some people don't know answers to questions they should say they don't know, otherwise don't tell me that something is possible and then two weeks later tell me it's not.  I believe the house will be of good quality but the customer service from the sales reps to the design center to the site super needs a severe improvement for me To ever buy from or recommend Tamarak to anyone."
TAM10191020,"Sales centre process was perfect. For the design centre process, it was difficult to get a hold of the representatives over the phone and more clarification on items for upgrade."
TAM0611106,"If there is a minor change to be made, that was overlooked, it would be nice if Tamarack could accommodate such a change. (Ex: Adding an electrical outlet to the island)"
TAM0912123,The second design center meeting felt very rushed. I think we could have benefitted from a longer session.
TAM0416109,"1)We would like to suggest that any yearly changes to structure and offerings made by head office be made available at the beginning of the calendar year for homes purchased after January 1st.
    a. We purchased our home in January of 2015 and were given the upgrade      bonus that was applicable at that time. We went to the design centre in early March and were given a copy of the upgrade lists and respective costs. We did not start the design process until much later in the year (July) and once the process started there was significant confusion as to what options were standard and what were not. We were given the list of the 2015 standard lighting (which we liked) but that list was later rescinded because, according to head office, even though we had purchased in 2015 we had to choose from the 2014 lighting list (which we did not like). After several negotiations, in January of this year we were finally offered 5 lights from the 2015 list to be installed at no cost.
    b. The same option list switch occurred when we chose our granite; an upgrade to us but standard for houses bought later in 2015. This was resolved eventually to our satisfaction but it did cause some distress. In several instances, there was a remarkable increase in costs for our upgrades which put some items outside our upgrade overrun budget causing considerable disappointment. 
    c. There seemed to be a significant lag between head office and the sales/design centres as to what options were standard versus upgrades. 

2)We would like to suggest more flexibility in making minor design changes in town homes as well as single homes
    a.We asked several times to have a design modification made to remove a non supporting post at the steps from the foyer to the open concept kitchen family room area. We really, really do not want that post and even though we offered to pay the difference for the costs of the additional newel post and railing, there was no negotiation and were told that such modifications would only be granted in a single family home not a townhome. If it were a matter of simply making the change later on at our own costs, it would not be an issue but a change down the road would require matching stains for a new section of wood flooring and step nosing as well as replacing a section of the railing. It would have been much less work effort and cost to make this change while the home was under construction.

Our experience in the Sales Ctre has been wonderful but it is the negative experiences with the Design Ctre and the significant delay in construction at a time when interest rates were on the rise that has resulted in an unfavourable reference for Tamarack to our friends and family."
TAM0717103,Nothing to change
TAM09191048,"We should have received a copy of our deficiency documented during our frame walk through,  we didn't receive a copy of the item marked no did we have a chance to look at the list.  No follow-up after the walk through,  we are not sure if they have fixed anything of if our item where properly documented. We hope for the PDI walk-though a copy of our deficiency list is provided."
TAM0816117,Nothing
TAM0414116,N/A
TAM0213124,"It was very difficult to arrangement appointments thru the design centre for those of us who have purchased quick-delivery homes. I'm also somewhat surprised I have yet to be called for a walk-thru inspection. A construction inspection should of been conducted upon the initial sale of the home. 

In comparison to other design centres, I found Tamarack's to be a little grungy.  Perhaps an update of the faucet and tile area is required."
TAM03182012,The only thing that I wished we discussed was the option to put a long thin window beside the front door.  I don’t remember being presented with that option at the time of purchase and structure.  Although our Sakes Rep was off on leave during our initial appointment.  We discussed a glass panel option within the door which we didn’t select.
TAM0413104,The process was ok !
TAM1114107,Sales and design centre are working at the same place which is easy for us.
TAM1109113,"We were to recieve a phone call on a given date stated in the contract to tell us if the house was on schedual or delayed, Noone called we had to call the office. Better follow up with contrat dates would be nice. This also occured on our walk through frame inspection. Lady who called to confimr date and time never confirmed with foreman so when we shoed up for walk through we had to wait while foreman was tracked down as noone confirmed with him the time and date."
TAM0414104,None
TAM0714106,Sales is great!  The design it's ok.
TAM1210122,"design center : more standard selection options , very limited by existing selection"
TAM1016108,"There should be a window of time or follow-up to the frame check walk through to make sure there are no additional concerns to be addressed, because the process is quite quick and things can easily be missed."
TAM1015106,Nothing comes to mind.
TAM03182021,"When I asked about changing or adding some structural features, the answer was always no. For example: We wanted insulation between bedroom walls but they would not allow for that for a town-home.  
The roof vents: Tamarack only offers mushroom vents but every roofer in the city suggests the max-air flow vents. I am personally going to have to pay a roofer to put those in because I know the problems that the mushroom vents cause. It is ridiculous that I did not have the option to change. I'm not sure why Tamarack thinks they are above the what everyone in the industry recommends.
Dry core floor:  was not able to add a one in the basement
Infrared heating in the bathrooms- I was not able to get that to get that through the contractor, they were not able to accommodate my request"
TAM06181004,"from my experience, i wouldn't change anything...i found Noella in the Sales centre to be exceptional knowledgeable  and Kim was incredibily helpful.   i hope you will have a survey to complete after have possession of the home to provide feedback as to whether all the specific modifications we asked for were accurately followed.   i am sure they will be but would like to be able to give that positive feedback if applicable as well"
TAM1209112,Had almost too many options to pick from.
TAM0712134,Understanding the difference between standard and optional and just what that implied.  Additionally who in the process are responsible for that.  My disappointment is with the HVAC and the front door events
TAM1216102,Nothing. They were great!
TAM09181003,"We were very happy with the design process.  If anything, it would be great to be in the model picking the selections but I understand how difficult that would be."
TAM10191002,"Offer more updated selections for basic offering. As well, updated products such as laminate floors and more current tile selection. The process worked very well."
TAM10191042,"Clearly identify what is upgrades and what is standard, and the cost of the upgrades. 
I think the models should have an option for a basement bathroom. I understand that there is limited space and headroom etc but it would really add to options and re-sale."
TAM08171002,"The markup on upgrades is unrealistic. When going to your supplier we realized the huge markup. When paying for a $700,000 home cheating out on the basics is unacceptable. Other than that great job."
TAM1116117,"Design Centre process was held up waiting for an appointment with Concepts,which when we finally got one, took hardly anytime at all.  I thought the design centre procedure was all finalized only to be informe weeks.ater that I still had to sign off on the Concepts work and the total packag of upgrades.  MIscommunication!  However,it all worked out in the long run."
TAM0614123,"Should be more flexible to accommodate client's request for changes
Our current home already had the outer shell done but some little changes that were requested could have been accommodated."
TAM10171006,All upgrades to be handled by design centre to better coordinate and manage upgrades and budget from buyer's perspective.
TAM0316107,WE were shocked by the cost of upgrading things.  There should be more transparency.
TAM0717100,"It would be very helpful if the options catalogue provided by sales actually matched the design centre catalogue. Also why do you display items in the design centre that may not be available, it causes confusion and extra work."
TAM0812130,"""more options for interior doors
better standard options"""
TAM0412119,"Sales center staff Valerie was not helpful at all after the initial sale.  When we approached her to point out some deficiencies with the house, we were repeatedly told 'oh it's better coming from you'.  We did not get the support to help us resolve some of these issues.  I have not been back to the sales centre since because I feel that it was a waste of time.  

Darryl is great to deal with and very accommodating.  The design centre process was great.  Kim Knuth was also very helpful with our selections and process.  Unlike Valerie, Kim went out of her way to see our complaints resolve.  

There is more to this business than taking my initial deposit to complete the sale.  There is a major lack of customer service from the sales office.  Therefore, I would not recommend this builder to friends and family in the future."
TAM0510133,"The only real issues we had with the purchase process were in the very beginning prior to deciding. It is misleading that the model home appears to be an open house, but entering forfeits the right to a real estate agent. There was no indication during the first visit that we would be denied representation, but we subsequently were. Also, when inquiring about what in the model home was upgraded or standard, the sales representative tried to draw from memory. Not surprisingly, several items were forgotten until a later time when we were far more committed to the purchase. We suggest a well-documented list of upgrades in the model home, and clear examples of samples that would be standard available in the model home for previewing. The only real issue we had since purchasing was that one of the interior selections we made was back-ordered and unavailable. We believe that if interior materials were ordered further ahead of time, the supplier could have met the demand before it was too late."
TAM05191028,"More flexible design centre apppintments
Better display of ceramic tiles
Have standard items available for display such as kitchen sink, basin, toilet...etc

Note:
Deb Durie was so knowledgable & responsive"
TAM08181002,Would not change a thing the designer I had by the name of Ms. Knuth was outstanding and Noella Francouer from the sales centre at Cardinal Creek has been outstanding and so has her team
TAM07191029,I'm not sure.
TAM07191031,A new design techniques may benefit customers before stepping into design center such as virtual design software with standard pricing.
TAM02171002,"Design centre was amazing.
Noella was also very professional and it was pleasant to work with both teams"
TAM0510123,"Everything was great with the sales centre, I couldn't be more than happy. The design centre process was great as well, I just recommend they be more thorough when reviewing all the options during the final appointment, so that all of the areas in the house are covered, and gone over to make sure all the right options were chosen."
TAM0517108,"longer appointment times at the design centre. Since we bought an inventory home, the timelines were shorter than typical, and it was difficult to make choices with such little time."
TAM0411120,"The design process was amazing! The lady that helped us make our design decision was friendly, helpful, and knew the materials the center offered 'like the back of her hand'. I would recommend her to anyone. 

The sales center staff were friendly but a little extreme. Valerie made the process fun but skipped over material that she thought wasn't important. We read the material on our own and were able to ask questions and get further explanation where needed. 

We are to move into our new house on April 27th and we still haven't done the framing inspection. The drywall has been put on, taped, mudded, and painted. The ceramic tile has been put in along with the base board in atleast the front hall. I contacted the Tamarack design center in the middle of December to see when our framing inspection would take place. They said to call the site supervior. I called Jule at the site office and left a message. My call was never returned! I then stopped in at the design center and they said to email Julie and she would reply to my email and that they would send her an email as well. The older British lady took down my name and phone number. I emailed Jule and received no reply and their was no reply from the email that apparently was sent from the design center. I then called the design center again and asked if they could email her my name and phone number. I finally called in the middle of January and talked to Julie. She said I had to talk to Darrel. I spoke with Darrel on the phone and he said we could have the inspection whenever we wanted. I asked why we hadn't been call previously and he didn't have an answer. 

I am extremely frustrated with this company and hope the rest of the process is easier. I chose Tamarack because I heard they were a great builder, their standards and specifications are superior to the competition and the location was very desirable to me and my boyfriend. If I knew there would be so many problems I would have chose a builder like Urbandale or Tartan who's homes are significantly cheaper and building in the area.   

We are looking forward to moving into our new home but it has been a stressful process!"
TAM1016136,We believe the process (as is) is the best way to provide answers to your needed design informatiob
TAM11171017,"Booking appointments especially people from out of town, there should be a week or two notice in booking them."
TAM0714107,More information about why certain upgrades cost more than what one would expect (additional plumbing costs for example)
TAM0715106,"The existing design centre is small - not all standard features are displayed which tends to promote perhaps more options purchases than necessary.  Pictures may be available but they don't convey reality.  I realize not all can be displayed but...  A picture of the fireplace doesn't inform the buyer that when you purchase the fireplace option, you will get the one that the lowest BTU output sold for that model.   I see this survey is coming to an end (94%) - I would have hoped to see space allocated to issues, of ex: the framed walk through took place but with a stand-in who didn't have the neck paperwork.  He was courteous and helpful but not the man.  And when questions are raised, we're told drywalling starts in two days, etc. And when questions are raised about why a 4 ft tall Rodgers box is place 11 ft from your main window (although assurances had been given on purchase that the company ensures side-entrance dwellings do not have obstructions or eyesores) all one gets is a generic reply ""it can't be changed"".  Someone failed to exercise proper coordination and supervision and nothing can be changed."
TAM0909104,N/A
TAM10191060,"1. I’m an interior decorator myself. Although I recognize that the show homes have a number of ‘upgrades’ I think it should be posted the base price and price as is .. I’ve worked with clients that find it frustrating when they fall in love w a home then see the extra cost involved to get their home like the show home.
2. I would like to have had More walk throughs at different stages. I’ve questioned the colour of my banister already from viewing through door and asked to see it but I wasn’t given a opportunity until the week before we take possession"
TAM0810112,"The design center needs to be more user friendly with regards to pricing and blue, green yellow dots etc..it is all very confusing right now.  A blue dot means different things in different areas. Standard in some , upgrade in others.
Also Tamarack needs to have plans drawn for the correct elevation of the house. At the moment we had to design our house using a mirror image plan. This was very confusing and resulted in errors. Surely it is not that difficult for the company to create the correct plan configuration!"
TAM0911135,Not so rushed....given clearer time frames of upgrades.
TAM09191009,The walk through after framing should provide a report of issues reported.
TAM1211106,"1.  Our names were wrong on this survey, it was 'Oonagh Elliott and Li Wang'
2. Lists of standard vs optional items list available up front, i.e. what items are standard and which ones we have to select, and if they are a) design center or b) other (fireplace, security, lighting etc.)
3. Homeowner checklist to make it easier to go through the whole selection process

Note - Kim Knuth of the Design Center was awesome - very knowledgeable, professional, helpful, personable.    She made the process much easier and in fact fun.  She is a real asset to your organization.  Also, Uwe from Muskoka cabinets was great also, I know she`s not a Tamarack employee, but since we are doing this survey, I would like to express our appreciation for her work also."
TAM10191019,I unfortunately did not have a design center experience as I purchased an inventory home. Maybe next time!
TAM0913122,A guided not a self tour. More explanation of extras costs at the outset.
TAM07181049,nothing really
TAM0111117,"The walk-through inspection during construction was not done with us.  We guessed this may be an oversight. As this is an important step in the building process, it should hence be given more attention."
TAM0612115,"Nothing I can think of at the moment, all in all a very good experience so far."
TAM0612122,Nothing  they are extremely professionnel.
TAM0815124,Knowing the products availability prior to show us
TAM0415101,We would have the design centre appointments with Muskoka and Tamarack made into one - there's really no reason to go meet with Muskoka simply to discuss cabinets.
TAM12181004,Happy with both the design and sales process.  Staff is very professional and friendly.   Very happy so far.
TAM0510147,more people working at the design center
TAM0314101,Let Mandy run the office - great personality and the girl who served us from the kitchen department - Eva super.
TAM1013102,We are very satisfied up to now and we hope that it will continue to the end of the process.  We really appreciate the knowledge and the welcoming approach of all the people we have dealt with.  Thank you
TAM01201013,no changes needed
TAM0312107,"The sales were helpful to a point. More suggestion from their part would be helpful. (changing layouts ) The buyer did not know the bottom line until the very very end. Does not help with budgeting.
Design centre was helpful but your standards, I am sorry SUCK . Ten years behind the times. I understand everybody has to made a dollar but the cost for the upgrades was a little to much to shallow. 
What i am saying is get with the times"
TAM01171011,"The initial sales process and staff were incredible to deal with and offered plenty of suggestions and resources to make us feel right at home and like part of the family.  They were even able to delay our closing to accommodate the birth of our daughter!  Thanks Deb and Mike!!
Once the sale was complete, however, it seemed that the emails that were sent to notify us of any design centre or walk-through updates seemed to come late and made it appear as though we were always running late or behind schedule.
Our first design centre meeting with Angela was a complete waste of three hours and left us feeling even more confused than when we arrived.  All we got out of her was a series of yes answers when we asked about coloring, style or anything else and advised several times that we may be better off going to the supplier themselves.  We did.  And were then told by the railing construction company that they deal specifically with the builder and not the buyers and that we should not have been sent there.
I immediately called Carla and advised that we would not return if Angela was to be our permanent consultant.  Carla solved the issue and then some by pairing us with Kim, who was completely unbelievable.  She was knowledgeable, opinionated and extremely helpful in our design experience and did in two hours what we were not able to do in 3+ hours in our first visit.  We can't say enough great things about Kim and Tamarack is very lucky to have someone like her on staff.
Our frame check walk-through was next, if it could be called that.  We were advised that this would be a time to check the framing  with the on site supervisor and go over where the electrical and plumbing and other details would be installed.  We were advised quite late, in our opinion, as I had asked previous to our notification when our check would be, that the drywall had been put up to keep up with scheduling.  The walk-through still went ahead and Steve was great in showing us around and filling us in on all of the ins and outs of the house skeleton however we still feel we were mislead in being assured this would be a true frame check.  This frame check was actually mentioned several times during the sales process and was touted as quite an experience.  We were not impressed.
Overall, our experience with Tamarack has been good so far and we appreciate the opportunity to be able to provide our feedback."
TAM05191012,"During our Frame walk-through it was very good and the house was not clean.  There was dog poo in various places within the house, mostly in the bathroom and in the tub.  It was very disturbing to see and gross."
TAM02171000,"I loved it all, except the design centre. Having more employees and better availability times would be quite wonderful."
TAM0412111,"I would have liked to have more detailed information on redesign process, and pricing of kitchen options prior to signing agreement.  Upgrades are hard to price out before going through the process.  That being said- whenever we asked about pricing upgrades, we were informed within 2-4 business days.  Would be nice to know upfront more detailed costing options."
TAM12191029,"Sales process seems good. 
For design, 
As a high end builder, tamarack should include central air conditioner, basement framework and rough in as their standard.

Also, it has very  limited options for standard hardwood. There are no options for standard bathroom or kitchen sink and faucet. Also the standard kitchen cabinetry design is very basic. 

For upgrade prices, it should be more justifying. Every upgrade price seems higher than the retail prices in home improvement stores. It doesn't seem to be applying proper credits for standard items."
TAM02182013,Have software that can help you see what the ideas/designs look like especially with the upgrades.
TAM0110116,"I had a problem when I visited a plumbing store and they did not have the list of items those are standard and we had to booked another appointment so they get the list. Make sure that all your partners must have to have this list s buyers could make th selecton either standard or upgrade.

Secondly, the list of price which was povided by design center dring first meeting, it contianed the wrong price for hardwood flooring for kitchen so I had a problem when I was mking my budget for house upgrade becuase I and my wife likes hardwood flooring.

Moreover, there is not enuogh choices available to select a color for standard carpet."
TAM0612106,With all the decisions that had to be made; we feel that four visits to the design centre rather than three would reduce some of the worry and concern on making important decisions. First home or last home; these are very long term decisions and the stress level should be at a minimum.
TAM10191055,Simplify the process of upgrades and make some prices available at sales centre to allow customers have ballpark ideas of what they want to upgrade based on budget.
TAM06191020,I wish sales would have explained where bulkheads were placed when asked. This caused a few problems in the frame walk through. Decisions were based on this and I guess design center may be partially to blame. I wish there was more time between the 2 appointments for the design process. I also wish there was some time or window to change structural aspects considering I wasn’t informed about the bulkheads etc. I also inquired about a change after the fact to the pantry depth and as turned down.... the design center even explained that many people have commented on the same thing and I would have spent more money in the design process had they let me make this change! The timelines are just too short when you place a hold on the property
TAM08181017,a much better website where you can see your house digitally with colors etc. I feel Tamarack is very behind in that respect. Would make design choices much faster and easier and less scary not knowing what the final product will give.
TAM06171007,I really enjoyed the whole experience.
TAM0614217,"Information provided for costs and inclusions with upgrades. For repeat home-buyers, we were able to catch most items which could have been detrimental; however, less experienced buyers could have run into some costly and time-consuming issues."
TAM0812114,"""I was originally told in the sales center that the size of specific things in the model home would be the same as that of what I would be receiving (example the size of the island). Although, when I went to the design center i was told that the size would not be the same and that I had to pay extra money to get the same island size as that in the model home.

Also, i informed my designed center representative that I wanted all the inside doors to be the same as the main door (during my first visit to the house). My representative told me that she would contact head office to inform them of the changes of the doors. This occurred during April and she stated she would get in touch with me within a week. Unfortunately, i did not get a response from her until June (when I sent an email to her requesting an update). This was very inconvenient for me and my family for not hearing from my representative for such a long period of time."""
TAM03182001,nothing necessary.
TAM1016141,"Nothing. For context, I am in the military and we are being posted so we only had a couple of days to find a home. Our experience was excellent but was also very short and we simply did not discuss some things or have repeated meetings with staff that might be more normal due to our time constraints."
TAM04171015,"We are very pleased with our experience so far. Deb was wonderful and very helpful. She  made us feel very comfortable as we went to the purchasing process. Kim and the superintendent were great as well. 

The only thing we are disappointed about is in regards to the color of the brick and our main door. When we initially asked prior to signing the agreement, we were told that we would be getting a wooden main door and grey/white brick. During our inspection we realized that we will have a glass door and red brick."
TAM12191014,Another meeting with the design specialist
TAM0811124,"Lining up outside the Sales office in March, and having to camp out overnight in zero degree temperatures was unreasonable. Otherwise, the experience was overall very positive."
TAM0317108,"THE DESIGN CENTRE LAYOUT SHOULD CLEARLY INDICATE WHAT PRODUCTS CAN BE CHOSEN FOR THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH HOUSE IS BEING BUILT.
AFTER CHOOSING HARDWOOD FLOORING AND PLANNING OTHER CHOICES AROUND THIS, WE LEARNED THAT OUR CHOSEN FLOORING WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN FINDLAY CREEK WHERE WE WERE BUILDING... VERY FRUSTRATING AND WASTED VALUABLE TIME AT THE DESIGN CENTRE.

HOWEVER, KIM KNUTH WAS A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH, PROFESSIONAL AND HELPFUL"
TAM0516118,The kitchens on display are outdated. Also the upgrades for hardwood and faucets always seem to change so the sales people from the flooring and faucets weren't updated on what was availble for the upgrades from Tamarack. It took longer than it should have.
TAM0312100,Everything was great.
TAM1115114,"The only thing would be the accuracy when relaying the information concerning the upgrades of the house.  For example we were under the impression that central air came with our choice, only to be told later at the design centre thatcit was an upgrade.
Overall, the experience has been great thus far."
TAM1015111,"Make a model houses looking more than a standard houses. It's help people to make a better decision, what they want to upgrade."
TAM0211118,Nothing - the people that work for Tamarack are great and very helpful.
TAM0816111,I wanted a particular feature the time selection for it (it was not offered) and it was too late to get it -- regarding frosted windows.
TAM05181005,"as an investor , i prefere that you give us the possibility to have two painting  colours included ."
TAM1115105,Would be so grateful for a quicker move in date ...have waited 14 months for my move in date [needed to rent]
TAM06181022,client has to very careful with all the documents and all the items (mistakes can be made in many places). more time for design center from your first appt. i was not aware that we are supposed to check for defeciencies in frame walk so more information would be good.
TAM01201024,"Have better examples of outside finishes... pictures of homes rather then a small sample board.
Add another visit to the design center selection process."
TAM03182033,"1) I found it unsettling that the sales centre would not negotiate even a small discount on the price of the house with me but is willing to pay agents 1%. Tamarack refused to even take $1,000 off the price for me but is willing to pay agents over $5,000. This costs both of us...

2) I think it would be worthwhile for Tamarack to invest in some computer programs at the design centre to allow customers to better visualize what there house will look like with different selections. It would make decision making easier and might even encourage people to do additional upgrades."
TAM0214110,"I would make the design centre process bit more seamless.  We felt we were given a run around with different suppliers for cabinetry, electrical (pot lights etc.) and bathroom vanity's.  Too many appointments, too many people to meet at different place/time. The experience was not the same at all places in fact it was below expectations.  We also felt that the prices of items selected at your suppliers were hiked up at OUR COST! 

Not the best experience but could use some improvements."
TAM1015131,A little less pushy with the home sales.
TAM04182015,"One thing I would recommend Tamarack is that the customer should be explained in details about the cost of an upgrade. Since the upgrades are very expensive, a clear explanation Ex: Rate/price per sq ft etc or whichever units are applicable to the Upgrade should be provided to the customer rather than just quoting a price which is like a shocker for the client. Overall Great experience. Would highly recommend to others."
TAM0210120,"Provide more time for option selections - upgrades. Time allocated was clearly not enough and we felt a bit rushed - clearly the most stressful throughout the whole process. Our design centre rep could have been more helpful. E.g, we did not know whether 'moving' the fireplace around in the basement was an option. We thought it was a fixed location. We were only advised about this by our site manager during our visit. Also, we ended up wasting time during our last design centre meeting on location of phone jacks and cable connections, when this could have been done during our first site visit - which is much easier given that we are on the location - rather than having to look at the blue prints. Our design centre rep should have advised us of the latter."
TAM1116116,it was adequate and I appreciated that the sales people did not hover over you when you came to the site.
TAM1113104,"Design center: upgrade added only to find out we could not have it as the Design Center/merchant  could not provide. We were credited for this upgrade. Addendum produced. Also, we received an email stating they forgot to charge an item. We advised we already had it in the list of items. Addendum is produced only to be advised by the Design center that we were right and that they made an error. A further addendum was produced.

Both the sales center and the design center we had to go in 3 times to sign official papers as there was always something missing. In the end everything got signed but should not have taken 3 times. 

Also, it would be a good idea when anyone from Tamarack sends an email to please put their telephone number under 
their name in case we must reach them. Several times I needed to do the Google search to find the numbers.

Tamarack as you wanted feedback I have provided the above which is very minor and please know that all parties involved have been more than welcoming us in our Tamarack journey.

Finally, I just want to say that I am looking so very much forward to moving into this dream home and giving my parents the well deserved years they have left into this new home. Thank you Tamarack for caring ."
TAM0713116,"Sales process:
-more knowledge about the standards vs. upgrades prior to getting to design centre stage.  
-better understanding of walk through process and what to expect
-more knowledge of the closing process and what to expect

Design centre:
-clients would benefit from going through the check list of upgrades with design consultant to ensure that nothing is missed or considered.
-should have improved design centre standards such as: shut-off valves, dark colour cabinet as standard (standard colour selection is very poor), dark hard wood as standard - only light to medium selections available.  
-Cabinet colour selection was confusing and should have been explained that only certain types of colours are available for certain types of cabinet styles
-Poor standard paint colour selection, and extremely disappointed in finding out that more standard paint colour upgrades were available after sign off.  Also disappointed that there was an additional cost to paint base boards white.
-Maxi vents not a standard or offered as an upgrade. (This is standard with most builders in Ottawa) and no explanation as to why this was not offered as an upgrade."
TAM09171017,"After we committed to buying the house, there was some dicfficulty gettng us into the Design Centre before we went back home. (NL) It seems to me that the Design Centre needs to have a greater and perhaps stream-lined process for out of towners. We are retired military so we have been through this process a number of times. We recognize there are people that take months to select their options but we have also done it in a few hours. We did get in before we left and then worked with our consutant  through email and to date are very satisified but the idea of leaving and having to come back just to choose options was almost a show stopper for us."
TAM07181021,I would provide more detail at the design centre process on which supplier would be responsible for which items and how it would be coordinated (ie. would I have to coordinate responses to my design centre consultant or would it be their responsibility to provide their information to them.)
TAM0414118,"The appliance package offered through the Brick. My experience with the Brick thus far has been beyond frustrating and the worst part of the process. Would have preferred a signing bonus to cover appliances that allowed me to shop where I would have preferred. Though it is not a short coming on Tamaracks end, it has tainted an otherwise excellent experience."
TAM0610131,"I am satisfied with what the current process is. I bought Tamarack home because your company has very good reputation which divide your Tamarack with other builders. I love my new home, although it hasn't finished yet. I hope the new home will be closed on time since the closing date has been postponded once."
TAM12191030,N/A
TAM04182011,"We were not notified about the referral bonus prior to the signing of our sales agreement. We were referred by a Tamarack home owner but did not obtain the referral bonus because we were unaware of it. If Tamarack is going to have the bonus, it should not be hidden from your clients or restricted to the box they checked (or didn't check) on the paper they filled out when browsing model homes. Otherwise, the sales team and entire process to date has been amazing compared to our last experience buying a new home."
TAM12181013,"Décor Center quoting process is to receive quote is too long.  2 weeks to receive pricing.    Every item should have a quote upfront and also available on-line. We received a lot of paper with upgrade option but no pricing.  This is not efficient.

Staff Sales and Décor are great!

Tamarack site customer service reps and trades  are not helpful.  They just keep telling us to write issues on our PDI instead of helping us. 

Not happy with the paint job.   

We asked for our fireplace to have not tile surrounding.  Before our PDI the ripped the  tile off the fireplace instead of properly removing the tile. 
The drywall and paint looks horrible.  It still has not been fixed,  I was referred to write it on our next PDI.

Appliances:  Lowes Service installer  advised that our dishwasher machine could not be installed as they are only contracted to install domestic appliances.  We were not advised of this and purchased Samsung.   We have to pay a different installer to install the dishwasher as the pipes need to be customized.  This is an out of pocket expense."
TAM1013106,"We had wanted to speak with the sales director about making a minor change to the closing date so we could qualify for a considerably better mortgage rate. After several phone calls, messages and emails, she (Debra Champagne) never returned our call.  We were very disappointed since we are repeatedly being reminded of how tamarack really cares about its customers. This experience really made us question how true this is.  Other than this experience, so far, all the other Tamarack employees have been considerate and helpful."
TAM0811100,"If you upgrade a feature i.e. floors, counters etc. you should get a credit for
the standard and pay the difference on the upgrade. After signing off you 
should still be able to make a change on your decision as long as the product
has not been delivered to the house. Buyer should be told ahead of time at the design centre of the 19%  HST. on upgrades. I assumed the HST was 
13% on everything. Quite a SHOCK!"
TAM0915116,We would have done more research before choosing our interior design. We changed our minds quite often.
TAM0710114,"As a second time home buyer with Tamarack, I was once again very disappointed with the options for paint and for the alarm system.  I believe you could avoid many conflicts with customers by having more choices here.  

I also believe that the colour scheme in the design center leads to nothing but confusion since it varies from product to product.  ie:  green, red, blue, yellow, green-yellow, green-blue, yellow-red...  even the employees have to make reference on occasion to be sure they're giving the correct upgrade scale."
TAM01181002,"We felt somewhat rushed through the design process, mostly because of staff going on holidays.

Would have been a bit easier for my wife if the staff of the design centre had been bilingual.

Very impressed with the sales centre."
TAM0416107,"1. Have pictures or sample pictures on the design centre notebooks or price list
2. More selections"
TAM0912108,I think it is important to have a VERY clear understanding of what are upgrades outside of the list provided. Having options to upgrade without getting the response: It's too expensive would have helped on making some other changes.
TAM0614210,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR THAT I COULD NOT HAVE THE STANDARD OPTIONS THAT I PAID FOR BUT DECIDED TO UPGRADE. I COULD SELL THESE ITEMS OR USE THEM ELSEWHERE IN THE HOME IE: MIRRORS, SHOWER INSERT (SINCE I'M GETTING HTE TILED OPTION), PAPER TOILET RACK AND LIGHTING ETC

IF THIS POLICY CHANGES, PLEASE LET ME KNOW. I WAS TOLD YOU USED TO LEAVE IT BEHIND BUT WAS AFRAID TRADESMEN WOULD STEEL THEM. TO ME, YOU HAVE CAMERAS WHICH SHOULD HELP CURB BUT WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE THE CHANCE AND HAVE THEM LEFT BEHIND. THANKS, 
VICKY 
905 BUNCHBERRY -"
TAM10191031,"The design process could be more streamlines and the team could communicate more effectively with each other. This would avoid awkward and non-value add time spent during the design process. Also, there shouldn't be an assumption that the buyer knows and understands all the standard vs. upgrades."
TAM0614219,Design centre- Have second appt be split into two appt's (The selections appt; it is very stressful trying to make all interior selections in one appt)
TAM04171011,Have more time for upgrades...In case we want to make changes....Felt a little rushed.
TAM0812112,more guidance or clearer direction on outside suppliers (anyone you need to see outside of the Tamarack design centre). This is confusing and even more confusing is who is responsible to replay information between these outside suppliers and your design centre rep.
TAM0614204,Nothing very good experience so far thank you
TAM11171019,Unsure.
TAM0511109,Pre inspection delivery book should have been handed out and  read by the client before the survey.
TAM0612108,Nothing everyone was very professional from Darlene and Sal in sales to Mandy in design
TAM0909103,I did not receive any blue prints and no one spoke to me about the construction of my house (this is why I rated that section of the survey poorly).
TAM1216108,I think they should reply earlier to the emails.  I had to remind them and push to get a reply to m emails.  I go to the model home to see what is standard and what was upgrade by looking at the home.  I thought what I saw in the model home was standard in my home but that was wrong.  The home was built 3 years ago and they don't use the same products anymore and they didn't tell me.  I feel that the design centre are not friendly enough and they don't treat everyone the same.  My first appt. was supposed to be 1 hour and mine was 45 minutes.  I stopped by on another day to pick paint colours I overheard another presentation and I feel that they were getting a lot more information than we did.  She had a poker face and never smiled at us.  I saw her smile at a lot of other people.  I think that is because I am not Canadian.  My face doesn't look like a regular Canadian and my English isn't that good so I think I was treated differently.
TAM1213102,one or two more meetings with rep to choose upgrades ... before the final signature....
TAM0210108,"We would build a bigger design centre that encompasses all products and upgrades available, similar to what Richcraft Homes offers. It is inconvenient, for a working couple with young children, to book appointments with several suppliers in addition to the design centre appointments.

Note that we left the blueprint meeting questions blank, as we did not have one. If it is no longer offered, we believe it should be reinstated.

We were never informed in writing that the construction had started. We would send a letter to confirm it.

We would streamline the process to get a plumbing upgrade quote. It took several weeks to get a quote for a shower door and faucet."
TAM0413105,"A little more time for the selection process to select the most suitable items as in my case, there was no model house for me to visit and base my choices on."
TAM0513114,Nothing
TAM1014116,"Not a big deal as Kim's was amazing, but we did feel that the appointments were a bit close together at the time (design center)"
TAM0314107,Sales staff was not very clear on the process(that we had to make decisions about kitchen through muskoka not Tamarack)put all standard options for homes in an area and then have other areas  for color upgrades. buyers will then see what is standard and go with those options or upgrade finishes
TAM0213105,"I had to wait outside over night to purchase my lot. I didn't like the lack of understanding or support that we received at this time. The way it was organized had potential neighbours really competing against one another. A simple number hand out for position would have been more appropriate rather than us sleeping in a certain order. 
As well, we found the exterior design options quite limited. 
It appeared that there were non standard cabinetry as well. Everything had a markup price.
We made some deletions from the standard (I.e. backsplash) and were given no credit in return, which we found quite surprising as well. 
Having said all of the above, we overall had a very good experience with tamarack.  We were especially happy with our Muskoka kitchens rep (Ewa). She was e exemplary, and had incredible customer service. We found she went above and beyond for us."
TAM07181022,Pretty good all positive.
TAM0713104,the whole experience was amazing :)
TAM0412106,"Our experience at the design center was fantastic.  Kim knows her business was able to guide us patiently throughout the process.  The framing inspection was also very reassuring.  Richard had picked up on a few issues that we would have never noticed.  His attention to detail spoke not only to his professionalism, but also Tamarack's commitment to providing a quality product.

Our experience at the sales center was slightly less positive.  On the few occasions that we needed to deal with them, we felt a little rushed by the staff.  We also felt that they were very unaccommodating to our children.  Finally, as customers who was about to spend over half a million on your products, we certainly did not feel like we were in control and that every effort would be made to address our specific needs.  As an example, the mere presence of our extremely well behaved kids clearly caused an issue with a staff member when we presented ourselves to sign our initial contract.  Furthermore, when came time to book our framing inspection, we were told that we essentially needed to go during the 4 hour window provided by them, or simply not have the opportunity to conduct the inspection at all.  We need to work big jobs to pay for your homes, and I would suspect that your company as a whole would want to adapt to our availability as customers. 

Overall, we are satisfied with how the process has progressed up to this point and are extremely excited to move into our new home.

Best regards,

Christine & Tim"
TAM08181048,All good
TAM0610133,More details in options re- framing design
TAM1112133,"It was a wonderful experience, very personal.  My only concern is the selling of my present home to meet the closure of my purchasing home."
TAM0413103,"Sales - Nothing
Design Centre - More time to make interior selections and more information on upgrade costs, quality etc. Although I did a lot of research ahead of time and had a general idea of what options and upgrades I wanted, I found the interior selection process to be too quick and was expecting the design consultant to propose ideas and options I hadn't thought of. It was quite a messy process."
TAM10181014,"1. Show cross-sectional diagrams of the rooms to customers at the same time as blueprints. The heights of windows were not shown to us at the time of purchase/structural changes, and as a result, our plans for two rooms cannot be fulfilled.

2. Some structural choices are contingent on design center options. We made several changes to the foyer of our home in order to accommodate a foyer bench by the window. We were told during structural selections that this bench would be a design center option and we would deal with it later. However, when the time came in the design center to purchase the bench, we were told that the window in the foyer was too tall to accommodate the bench. This problem should have been identified to us at the structural phase, before we invested in structural changes that would not be compatible with our desired design changes. Had we known this problem at the structural phase, we could have also paid to have a shorter window placed in the foyer in order to accommodate our bench. Furthermore, the bench was actually drawn in our blueprints at the structural stage, and nevertheless, Muskoka refused to install the bench and Tamarack refused to modify the window in order to comply with the blueprints.

3. The exact same problem as described above in point #2 occurred with bedroom3/office. The desks that we wanted to have Muskoka install against the window could not be accommodated because the window was too low, and again, the position of the window was not identified to us at the time of purchase/structural.

4. Tamarack refused to fix the above issues even though we were willing to be flexible (i.e. we were willing to delay closing or even have Tamarack or another contractor of their choice fix the issues after closing). Tamarack credited us the cost of our structural changes to the foyer and bedroom3 window (for design center options), but we were willing to spend even more money to have our plans realized. Tamarack was not willing to make any changes and only provided the credit at face value. We are still in a position where we only have half of what we wanted and now need to spend more money to have an independent contractor come in after closing to fix the problems.

In summary, the above problems are why we have selected 5/10 for recommending Tamarack to friends. The design center portion of our process was extremely well organized, enjoyable, and efficient. However, the difficulties resulting from structural cost us many months of time and frustration. Based on Tamarack's reputation in the city, we trusted that Tamarack would build us the home of our dreams, however, our overall experience has been underwhelming."
TAM1213103,I had an excellent experience and was really served by experts.
TAM0412108,"I would have wanted more options available to negotiate upgrades.  I don't see the benefit to Tamarack to have a 'take it or leave it' position on all upgrade choices.  An incentive program (eg. spend 100,000 and receive 10% rebate, etc.) would also have made the process more attractive.

It's frustrating and disrespectful when you are spending over half a million dollars on a product to be treated like your dollar has no value to the vendor outside their rigid, non-negotiable terms.

I would also like to have seen better coordination between the Design Centre and various dealers (including Muskoka).  We discovered at times that changes we made with one were not necessarily communicated or documented with the other.

During the walkthrough, the on-site rep was helpful and knowledgeable but we had no idea if our concerns were documented and would liked to have received follow-up summarizing the meeting and their commitment to the required changes."
TAM1011109,"- improved documentation and responsiveness for design upgrades from Muskoka Kitchens, more integrated discussion of pulls and knobs
- more realistic pricing on upgrades for exterior frontage (eg.  stone masonry pricing was comical)
Need to modernize so"
TAM0811127,"More time, better explanation of events and timelines"
TAM0413118,More communication through email. Detailing the dates to which selections must be done to avoid any stops in construction.
TAM0511132,"Better & timely understanding  of what structural upgrades are possible before paper work is final (from the sales center).
Working patiently with the clients to manage the upgrade details (especially with the kitchen redesign) ."
TAM1011131,You need at least one more scheduled appointment with your designer.  You also need to re-vamp your kitchen backsplash selection as it is either very costly or not much of a selection in standard or one or two levels up.  We opted out of selecting a standard or upgrading because of this.
TAM05191023,Have a digital view of design choices once they have been made
TAM0909119,I will recommend Tamarack to respect the closing date and to advise the Household for any changes about the closing date
TAM10191010,"I would change all the advertising for the Cambridge model home or any other model home that uses a LOW HEAT venting solution to distribute warm air throughout the basement. All advertising materials to date show a flush wall in basements that use a LOW HEAT vent (no protrusions out of the wall), but actually this solution results in a column jutting out of the wall by about a foot. This is misleading advertising or at least advertising that hasn't been updated yet. No one pointed this out to us at the Sales Centre, at the Design Centre, at Concept Homes, and it wasn't even pointed out to us during our Frame walkthrough. It was only acknowledged after we noticed it and shared our frame walk photos. This could be seen as deceptive. Why is this a big issue? When we talked to Mandy and to Concept Homes about placing our entertainment system against this wall, there was no mention of a column protruding out of the wall. No mention when we put a conduit and our network outlets in this area either. We bought the entertainment system (thousands of dollars), as well as all the furniture oriented to the entertainment system (tens of thousands of dollars). And now the entertainment system doesn't fit. We had to personally complain to Head Office to sort this out. We think it's important to be transparent and to communicate building solutions that physically change the space your customers will be living in.
During our design process and before we had signed our final papers, we had asked for an additional outlet to be put into our ensuite bathroom near our toilet. Mandy said she would ask Head Office whether this was allowed and at a later date. After we had signed our design documents, Head Office said it wasn't possible citing bylaws. We asked again about different configurations on how it could be included. Flat out no, not even an attempt to work with us to make it happen. Later we find out additional outlets at counter height have been placed into other Tamarack ensuite bathroom units (with photos to prove it). After learning about the inequality in customer service being provided to us, we tried to push for this additional outlet some more. Flat out rejections citing no additional electrical work would be tolerated. We'd recommend checking your customer service practices to ensure you treat all customers fairly and that consistent customer service practices are provided to all."
TAM0710110,"We are quite happy with our experience so far.  We love the design of the home and the community layout.

A few things - during our scheduled appointment to sign the purchase agreement, the salesperson excused herself to serve another client.  It was a little frustrating since we were spending alot of money, and it didn't feel like our time and purchase were being valued.  Also, without having a good understanding of what was deemed as a structural change versus something at the upgrade centre, we later found out that a certain change we were hoping to include (stone fireplace) was in fact a structural change.  It's hard to know what is structural at the time of signing when you are just starting to think about different upgrades, and it is unfortunate when you are told that something you would like cannot be done at a certain stage (increased ceiling height in basement, central vac toe plates).  A list of example structural upgrades would have been very helpful.  

We experienced a delayed closing notification - we received a letter that incorrectly referred to our closing being 'tentative' when in fact we signed a firm agreement.  This delay was a little frustrating, considering how far in advance we purchased and how the salesperson told us that Tamarack was known for being on time, in contrast to another builder in the area without the same reputation.  It was a big reason why we decided to buy with Tamarack.  I think that we would have expected a delay with a shorter completion period, but with such a lead time, we were disappointed.  

As for the design centre, there were some standard selections that seemed quite dated.  It was great to have such a wide standard selection, however, it would have been better to have more current styling.  We were disappointed that our community featured a different type of hardwood flooring, since the standard options were not comparable to the other communities, forcing us to upgrade to achieve the colour we wanted (and had seen as standard in various Tamarack models).  We rated our design centre consultant as not telling us about the value-add of upgrades, because that didn't seem applicable and the survey didn't present an opportunity to indicate that.  It was tough to pick all the options in 3 appointments, so outside visits should be strongly suggested!

Overall, we are happy with our sales and design centre experience.  

Finally, the survey asked us to rate the inspection - we close in nearly 2 months, and we still haven't yet had our inspection.  Considering we purchased our home nearly 15 months in advance of closing, it would have been great to receive status reports since we don't know how far in advance certain stages are to take place."
TAM0512106,"I wish Tamarack would keep us informed more often as to what is happening in our home since this is an exciting time for all home owners! Also, we found the options to be very pricey!"
TAM11191003,"More time, lots of meeting during the week. We both still work and time away from work wasn't easy."
TAM0113105,"Deb Dennison was fantastic - very warm, welcoming, knowledgeable.  She really connected with us and provided us with outstanding customer service.

Ewa from Muskoka was also excellent - we really appreciated her prompt responses to enquiries, her professional advice but also her warm, welcoming interaction.  Even though we were on a schedule, we never felt rushed or dismissed.  Fantastic customer service.

I will suggest better guidance for the design centre process.  Knowing we would have a short timeframe to make our selections and limited appointment time, we really strived to be prepared for those scheduled meetings by spending time at the design centre in advance.  We really tried to have most of our selections ready to go.  Our first interaction at the design centre was really discouraging.  The part-time receptionist was really unwelcoming, unapproachable and impatient.  The upgrade list wasn't well explained and we would have appreciated if someone could have spent even ten minutes with us to explain how to start and proceed.  I would also suggest that the tile be better organized, by upgrade selection.  It was difficult to come back and try and find a particular tile.  Choosing finishings for your home is not comparable to purchasing a new shirt, I understand that deadlines must be met however we would have appreciated a more welcoming approach.  That being said, once we met with Kim Knuth, everything was back on track.  She was accessible and very helpful.  Overall, we were extremely pleased with our Tamarack experience and look forward to seeing our finished home!"
TAM06181001,It is a detailed process so I don't think there is anything to improve.
TAM04182026,Can't think of any. All the staff were so pleasant.
TAM06172006,NA
TAM09191029,"Very unhappy with lack of communication and commitment with Head Office and the builder.  Our initial closing date was scheduled for  July,  we booked our family vacation to Europe to accommodate our vacation to be notified that our closing date was moved the Aug 19th.   The builder promised no more delays will occur an we cancelled our vacation and rescheduled the date, yet we received another notice of delay for Sept 16th.  We are extremely disappointed with the delay and having to cancel our vacation which the builder was made aware of. We also haven't received any communication regarding our walk through we have emailed Head Office and no one has responded.   Our friend who have purchased within the same community and builder have received their dates for the walk through.   We are very disappointed."
TAM0610114,"Maybe have a bit more time to choose stuff, or at least not be so far in advance of the house being ready.  I would like to comment on Jacqui & Carolyn...these girls are jewels, and I hope you're paying them well because they do a fantastic job!"
TAM0715105,Everything was very satisfactory
TAM0715109,I would not change anything. We had a great experience and have already recommended Tamarack to friends
TAM0511129,"For sales centre: while we were initially visiting different model homes throughout the Tamarack Community, we wish the people in the sales offices in all the locations were equally friendly and welcoming.

For design centre: might be a good idea to add few more choices in the standard options (carpets, faucets, sinks and light fixtures).

As a home buyer, I should be proud to have a Tamarack Home. If that's the reputation, Tamarack will stand out high above the other builders for times to come."
TAM0413114,More frequent visits to the construction site to review progress.
TAM1118109,I would be honest with clients and not coerce them to buy something they did not want.
TAM02182016,"I think that there are some things that they could do to help people with limited experience. If I was not in the industry, I would not have understood what was going on. They should work on keeping you up to date between each process, you kind have to assume what is happening. Maybe on a 2-3 week basis so I know where things stand. If I had not called, I don't think I would have had an opportunity to do the frame stage walk through. They should also make it clear what is an upgrade and what is not. Make it clear how it will affect the overall cost.  They should encourage the homeowner to go to the design center outside of their appointments so they can decide what they want before or between appointments. The rest of the process has been pretty straightforward. Tamarack has really improved their process, but I think there is still room for improvement in terms of keeping people informed. Encourage open communication with clients."
TAM12171000,I can't think of anything right now.
TAM0815111,Notify the client at the beginning of the process that when you receive a signing bonus well it's actually tax deductable. We chose all our upgrades at the design centre thinking of having 10 000$ free upgrades and by surprise at the end of the process we found out that that amount was taxed therefore we received 8 000$. That was not part of our budget. Please tell the client at the beginning of the process.
TAM1010119,did not enjoy the Kitchen Design experience
TAM1009107,Have the selection of upgrades made easier
TAM09191043,Can’t think of it
TAM0812132,"""Will like to get accurate information on time. Also please explain and provide valid reason with example while changing the closing date. 
Do not send emails well in advance advising the customer to look forward to receive call for home inspection  at different stages during construction,  when you are not intending to follow it up (calling the customer for inspection) for months."""
TAM0510111,Have a local kitchen firm.  It is extremely inconvenient to deal with a showroom and staff in Ottawa for kitchen.  Also encountered some frustration with the staff at Muskoka.  It would also be helpful to have greater flexibility on things with Tamarack.  No seems to be a fairly common response after a certain date and that's not a good response when you are spending this kind of money.
TAM11191001,Having access to the timing of what has been completed and what was left to do. We were very excited about every step.
TAM0915105,Don't have discontinued items on the floor. Prices could have been more reasonable.
TAM06181007,"Nothing, it great."
TAM08181020,"1. Structural Design - Bradbury Model:  Our Sale rep, Deb, was excellent, caring, attentive, supportive, knowledgeable, and took pride in her job/responsibility.  Unfortunately, this process felt very rushed given the timelines from head office. Ultimately, this led to us missing out on a structural upgrade that we had not considered as part of our discussion at the early stage of planning (i.e. 9' basement ceiling to accompany our finished basement selection). Also, the process of pricing structural items were disconnected with the design center, thus it proved challenging to devise an all encompassing ""upgrade plan"" with rough order pricing to align with our desired budget/plan.  Moreover, without meeting with kitchen cabinet design consultant, it was near impossible to garner an estimate for a custom kitchen, thus impacting on budgeting/planning when considering early stage structural design and selections. Overall, I posit that the normal structural process is  relatively simple for buyers; however, when customizing a large home, including finished basement design, interior structural changes, and trying to balance overall budget/plan for later stage design upgrades proved difficult and disconnected.
2. Design Centre: It became apparent that the ""allocated time"" for the design centre appointment with our consultant was highly insufficient. The initial meeting was clear, but overly generic and not tailored, nor capable to provide the buyer with answers to questions relating to samples, standard vs. upgrades, etc.  Although it was recommended to visit the design center on our own time, it becomes difficult to commence this process when we can't ask specific questions to guide pre-selections/coordination in advance of the formal design meeting with our assigned consultant.  Although I scored this area lower in the previous survey question, it is not reflective of our actual design consultant, Kim, who was excellent, knowledgeable, and supportive of our desires and needs, as she went well beyond the allocated time given to her.  I strongly suggest that there should be consideration for the scale/size of model selection, coupled by level of complexity and volume for intended design upgrades, customization when allocating the design center meeting with the consultant.   This consideration should be extended to both a separate cabinet session as well as interior design session.  15 minutes to design a kitchen is not acceptable, nor fair for your suppliers and/or staffs.  We were fortunate that our consultants (Kim and Ewa) extended their sessions, albeit it rushed to cover everything in person and required greater discussion after to finalize.   This particular build was our third new home construction process, hence we were already quite familiar with the general process and had a relatively clear understanding of what options/features we sought, thus reducing decision-making, but the combination of long delays for unpublished pricing through head-office, coupled by poor drafting considerations at head office (i.e. mud-room configuration for laundry tub plumbing. door locations/swing and HVAC) impacted the process and inhibited our ability to perform a weighted analysis of cost/benefit for our selections against our budget, never mind the frustration of additional meetings and required amendments with our sales rep to correct the structural design for our mud room more than 5 months from initial contract.   
3. Hidden Costs: There were a number of ""hidden costs"" within the design center process not listed or identified in the pricing package that became apparent when we received the pricing sheets from Concept and Head Office (i.e. low voltage pot light surcharges for dedicated/separate wiring that was not compatible with standard 120v, including surcharge for switch's/dimmers for the low voltage power). Given the volume of selected pot lighting, this additional cost was considerable and not planned, yet were left with little option as we already completed our design appointment.  From a perspective of transparency and buyer satisfaction, this is one critical element that would deter me from recommending Tamarack to family, friends, or colleagues. It truly felt that we were being ""nickel and dimed"" without even being advised in advance of the costs or given an alternate solution as that is the only product offered by your sub-contractor. This item was specifically brought forward to my sale rep, as she was not even aware of the added costs, thus unable to guide and advise her clients or prospective clients, thus signaling and confirming an issue. No response was provided to me from head office or senior management, nor were any cost options proposed to make it right.  
Further, there were multiple variations of model pricing lists, which had conflicting upgrade descriptions and actual price discrepancies, and in some cases were not relevant to the model design/structure (i.e. master bath shower tile/custom glass). On numerous occasions I had to prompt the our design rep to point out such details to pricing section at head office to correct the pricing. Attention to this detail is important for the buyer and reflects lack of administration and customer service to ensure a smooth and transparent process for the buyer. It was only I who was attentive who sought to correct these pricing issues, otherwise, Tamarack would have continued to over-charge the customer. 
4. Framing/Electrical walk-through inspection:  The site supervisor, Gary, was very knowledgeable, professional and supportive - very happy with his service and care for the buyer.  However, it was unfortunate Tamarack booked my inspection immediately following his 2 week vacation period, thus it not only prevented him from being able to review the site in advance against the plans, upgrades, to ensure the home was ""ready"" by his site workers.  Consequently, despite all best efforts, the home was not ready or at an expected standard for the inspection, including a number of items that did not comply with the purchase agreement, structural upgrades, and design center/electrical upgrades (i.e. wiring locations for Concept installed entertainment/speakers, garage door location, missing plumbing in mud room, incorrect location of HVAC ducts in mud room and basement bedroom, incorrect height of fireplace placement, location of water line for kitchen fridge, water puddles in second floor vapour barrier ceilings, etc.). Although these items are relatively minor in nature and can be easily rectified, it does create added delays that could have been prevented by the builder through better communication.  Unfortunately, when a buyer becomes responsible to point out errors wrt specs, it creates hesitation and concern from a project management perspective and final output to be received.  I would like to reiterate that it was explicitly noted during the inspection that the incorrect placement of Concept speaker wires/hook-up juncture in the family room required movement as per the design plan, and for the wires NOT to be spliced and extended, but rather re-run without breaks to negate any sound deterioration.  
5. Overall, the staff of Tamarack have been great and I couldn't ask for more, which has made this process go more fairly smooth and made us happy with our Tamarack selection; however, the points noted above do raise concern from my perspective, thus I'd strongly recommend executive management apply consideration to improve the process, output, relationships, to enhance customer experience.  We very much look forward to the final product and taking possession of our Bradbury, Lot6B, as our long-term family home in Poole Creek.

Sincerely,
Andre Savard"
TAM0416112,"Nothings.sales person was excellent. Design center (mandy) was great and very helpful picking finishings.
Keep up the good work."
TAM0717114,Nothing I don't think.
TAM0414115,"We found the selection of finishings a bit confusing.  The process of selecting things, getting quotes and making decisions was challenging.  When you are in the design room or out at the flooring or tile store, it would be nice to have a ball park idea of how much things may cost instead of wasting a lot of time on expensive quotes.  We felt that we should be able to understand what the Tamarack credit for the standard finishing was so that we could estimate the difference in cost... but this seemed to be something we were not privy to.  Additionally, we found the cost for upgrading hardwood to be very unreasonable (particularly the charge to upgrade from carpet to regular hardwood and then again an upgrade to our selected hardwood).  We felt there was no credit for the savings on the carpet cost.  Additionally, on our initial review of the appendix with our upgrades, the initial charge to go from carpet to hardwood was not included, so the price we agreed to pay actually went up by several thousand dollars upon head office review.  This lead to disappointment as we had to make cuts in other areas such as crown mouldings and omit hardwood in the bedrooms to compensate for the oversight and to keep the house within our budget.  

To solve these issues, could there be a guide of some sort given to the purchaser (similar to the way the cabinets are coded and you can look up the cost of it right away - much more transparent)? 

The women who work in the design centre are lovely and helpful, this is not a criticism of their abilities or customer service but rather it is more about the process. 

Lastly, we would change the timing of signing the commitment to purchase document.  You are required to sign off on purchasing the house before you have an understanding of what the upgrades will cost to have the home built the way that you want it.  In our case the discrepancy was almost $100,000 which we were not anticipating at all. Many people ball parked upgrades to be in the range of 30-50,000 when we asked.  Of course you can't know a persons taste when asking that question and we wanted to make our home unique and to our taste.  Informed decision making at the outset would be a more ethical process. You should be able to price out all of your upgrades before committing to the purchase. 

Overall, we are excited about moving into our new home and have had good experiences otherwise."
TAM0411110,"We had an excellent experience at the sales centre. The staff was very welcoming, informative, and helpful. 

However, the design centre experience was quite disappointing. Scheduling wasn't accommodating our schedules and our work schedules didn't allow meetings during weekedays. I felt the meetings were rushed due to time contraints. Some items had a wide variety of selections, but then many items weren't. Standard items weren't even displayed but showed in photos, which made us feel that the close to half million house doesn't come with adequate standard features. Though quite frustrating and stressful experience at the design centre, the desgin centre consultant was knowlegeable and very straightforward. I liked it how the consultant had a good sense of matching items - countertops, tiles and cabinet and also patience. I was under the impression that the design centre was under staffed. 

We just had our first walk though, very exciting. Our concerns were all received and addressed.

Hope our feedback helps improving the process."
TAM09191000,Nothing
TAM0914106,"My sales representative was excellent, however there is a large disconnect between the sales centre and the design centre. For example, my sales representative informed me that I could ask the design centre to put in the rough ins for an air conditioner and then I could purchase the actual air conditioner unit after closing. The design centre no longer offers this option and therefore I had to purchase the air conditioner from the design centre. I don't believe my sales representative purposely mislead me; rather better communication between the sales office and the design centre is needed."
TAM0812137,"To explain all the information a bit more slowly, especially for first-time new home buyers, so as not to rush the customer There's a lot if info to digest and it's very easy to overlook an item or a vital piece of info.  To explain thoroughly and with precision this info - customers can often misunderstand what's being said.  To please charge more reasonable prices for upgrades, many of which seemed extravagant, so that it's a win-win situation for both customers and company."
TAM0711106,"I am very disappointed at some of the standard features offered by the company. For example, the standard carpets are so old fashioned that I am ashamed that this was offered for a house that was over 500k. We designed the kitchen through Muskoka and there was a design fee althouhg it was exactly the same as the model home. I simply can't understand the design fee (roghly 20K). Things like that makes me feel that the whole design process is a rip off. I have gone through this process before in Toronto and it was a totally different experience; albeit a pleasant one."
TAM0714116,n/a
TAM0713100,"Completed the process for two Tamarack homes, and both times were great. If I could think of anything for the design centre, maybe having a few more photos of several of the popular options that are actually in homes, or a sticker indicating that a particular option is found in a specific model home ex: as seen in Eton model home in Chaperal."
TAM0715117,"The kitchen design took weeks to come back with pricing. It greatly inhibited our ability to make other decisions on upgrades and design features. It also put us over our 45 time allotment for selections, through no fault of our own."
TAM09191023,no comment
TAM0710117,"During the kitchen selection process only - Muskoka kitchen area with Henrietta, I felt very much that the she was not  really impressed that I was not upgrading the kitchen pot drawers etc. and extras. It came off in her attitude. I am in sales and it was not hard to pick up on. I did upgraded the cupboards in the other area, and Kim was very helpful with working with me to find the proper finishing for the home."
TAM08191010,Nothing
TAM0413121,Everything was great. Very streamlined.
TAM06171019,Sales and design centre were perfect. The inability of choosing a water heater but going for a pre-defined water heater company was a BIG disappointment. That should be changed !
TAM0516105,The design process felt rushed with all three meetings booked close together.
